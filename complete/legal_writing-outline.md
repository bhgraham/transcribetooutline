# Legal Writing Outline

## I. Sources of Law
- **A. Division of Governmental Authority**
  - U.S. Constitution and state constitutions divide authority into three branches:
    - Legislative: Makes laws (statutes)
    - Executive: Issues rules and regulations

  - Rules with which citizens must abide
- **C. Secondary Authority**
  - Summarizes, analyzes, or comments on the law
  - Includes law review articles, treatises, and hornbooks
  - Not the law; generally not cited in court documents or legal memoranda
  - **Note:** Distinguish between primary and secondary authorities; when in doubt, look it up

## II. Mandatory vs. Persuasive Authority
- **A. Definitions**
  - **Mandatory Authority:** Primary authority that courts are obligated to follow
  - **Persuasive Authority:** Authorities that courts may follow if persuaded
- **B. Determining Authority**
  - Jurisdiction affects whether a primary authority is binding
  - Example: New York's motor vehicle laws are binding for conduct within New York
  - **Exercise:** Identify whether authorities are mandatory or persuasive for a New York court

## III. Research Strategy
