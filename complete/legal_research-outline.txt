## IV. Analyzing Cases
- **Case Flags and Treatment**
  - **Yellow Flag**: Indicates negative treatment but not reversed or overruled
  - **Red Flag**: Indicates the case has been reversed
  - **Red Striped Flag**: Case no longer good law for at least one issue
  - **Blue and White Striped Flag**: Case has been appealed and is awaiting decision
  - **Orange Triangle**: Case may no longer be good law due to reliance on overruled decision
- **Citing References Tab**
  - Breakdown of sources citing the document
  - Importance of reviewing how other cases have treated the case
- **Table of Authorities**
  - Quick view of authorities relied upon by the document
