# Property Outline

## I. Introduction to Estates and Land
- Estates as foundational concepts in real estate and estate planning.
- Origin in English common law from feudal times.
- Importance of memorizing and understanding terminology.

## II. Categories of Estates
- **Fee Simple**
  - Fee Simple Absolute
  - Fee Simple Defeasible
- **Life Estate**
- **Leasehold Estates** (to be studied in week six)

## III. Fee Simple Estates
- **Fee Simple Absolute**
  - Definition: Potentially infinite duration.
  - Language of Conveyance: "To A and his heirs" or simply "To A."
  - Heritability: Interest can descend to legal heirs.
  - Characteristics: Alienable, divisible, and descendable.
  - Words of Limitation vs. Words of Purchase:
    - "And his heirs" are words of limitation, not purchase.

- **Fee Simple Defeasible**
  - Definition: Fee with a limitation or condition that may cause termination.
  - Types:
    - **Fee Simple Determinable**
      - Durational language (e.g., "so long as," "until," "during such time as").
      - Automatic termination upon violation of the condition.
      - Future Interest: Possibility of Reverter.
    - **Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent**
      - Condition subsequent language (e.g., "but if").
      - Requires action to terminate (right to reenter).
      - Future Interest: Right of Entry/Power of Termination.
    - **Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation**
      - Condition subsequent with divestment to another transferee.
      - Future Interest: Executory Interest.

## IV. Life Estate
- Definition: Estate measured by a person's life.

## V. Detailed Examination of Fee Simple Defeasible
- **Fee Simple Determinable**
  - Example: "O conveys Greenacre to A, so long as the land is used for farming."
  - Present Interest: Fee Simple Determinable.
  - Future Interest: Possibility of Reverter (automatic upon condition violation).

- **Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent**
  - Example: "O conveys Greenacre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, O has the right to reenter."
  - Present Interest: Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent.
  - Future Interest: Right of Entry (requires action to exercise).

- **Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation**
  - Future Interest held by a third party (transferee).

## VI. Important Concepts
- **Alienable**: Transferable inter vivos.
- **Divisible**: Transferable through a will.
- **Descendable**: Transferable through intestate succession.

## VII. Exam and Test Notes
- **Important**: Understanding the language of conveyance is crucial.
- **Tests**: Recognize and correctly identify types of defeasible fees.
- **Right and Wrong Answers**: Clear analysis once component parts are learned.

This outline provides a structured overview of the key concepts related to property estates, focusing on the types of fee simple estates and their characteristics, as emphasized in the lecture.

# Property Law Outline

## I. Defeasible Fees
- **A. Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent**
  - Definition: A present interest that can be terminated upon the occurrence of a specified event.
  - Example: O conveys Greenacre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, O has the right to reenter.
  - Interests:
    - A has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent (present interest).
    - O has a right of entry or power of termination (future interest).
  - Key Points:
    - The right of entry is not automatic; O must exercise the right to reenter.
    - **Important for Exams**: Understand the distinction between automatic and non-automatic divestment.

- **B. Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation**
  - Definition: A present interest that automatically divests in favor of a third party upon the occurrence of a specified event.
  - Example: O conveys Greenacre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, then to C.
  - Interests:
    - A has a fee simple subject to executory limitation (present interest).
    - C has an executory interest (future interest).
  - Key Points:
    - The executory interest operates automatically to divest A's interest.
    - Terminology: Executory limitation and executory interest are interchangeable.
    - **Important for Exams**: Compare and contrast with fee simple subject to condition subsequent.

## II. Life Estates
- **A. Life Estate**
  - Definition: An estate measured by the life of a person.
  - Examples:
    - O conveys to A for life (life estate measured by A's life).
    - O conveys to A for the life of B (life estate per autre vie).
  - Interests:
    - A has a life estate (present possessory interest).
    - O has a reversion (future interest).
  - Key Points:
    - At the conclusion of the life estate, O's reversion becomes possessory, resulting in a fee simple absolute.

## III. Future Interests
- **A. Future Interests Held by Transferor**
  - **1. Reversion**
    - Definition: A future interest retained by the transferor when a lesser estate is carved out.
    - Example: O conveys to A for life; O retains a reversion.
  - **2. Possibility of Reverter**
    - Definition: Accompanies a fee simple determinable.
    - Example: O conveys to A so long as A uses the land for farming.
  - **3. Right of Entry/Power of Termination**
    - Definition: Accompanies a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.
    - Example: O conveys to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, O has the right to reenter.

- **B. Future Interests Held by Transferee**
  - **1. Contingent Remainder**
    - Definition: A remainder that is either subject to a condition precedent or held by an unascertainable person.
    - Example: O conveys to A for life, then to C if C graduates law school.
  - **2. Vested Remainder**
    - Definition: A remainder held by an ascertainable person without a condition precedent.
    - Example: O conveys to A for the life of B, then to C.
  - **3. Executory Interest**
    - Definition: A future interest that divests a prior interest upon the occurrence of a condition.
    - Example: O conveys to A, but if A dies before B, then to B.

## IV. Methodology for Analyzing Future Interests
- **A. Identifying Remainders**
  - Look for a prior supporting estate (e.g., life estate, term of years).
  - Determine if the remainder is contingent or vested.
- **B. Recognizing Executory Interests**
  - Identify if the interest divests a prior interest.
  - Determine if the condition is precedent or subsequent.

## V. Conclusion
- **A. Application**
  - Apply knowledge of estates and future interests to analyze conveyances.
  - **Important for Exams**: Practice distinguishing between different types of defeasible fees and future interests.

# Property Outline

## I. Introduction to Future Interests
- **Definition**: A future interest is a presently existing legal interest with the possibility of future possession.
- **Types of Future Interests**:
  - Interests held by a transferor
  - Interests held by a transferee

## II. Remainders
- **Definition**: A remainder is a future interest that follows a prior supporting estate.
- **Types of Remainders**:
  - **Contingent Remainders**:
    - **Definition**: A remainder that is subject to a condition precedent or ascertainment issue.
    - **Examples**:
      - "To A for life, then to B if B reaches the age of 25" (Condition precedent: B reaching age 25)
      - "To A for life, remainder to A's children" (Ascertainment issue: A has no children at the time of conveyance)
      - "To A for life, remainder to B if B survives A" (Condition precedent: B surviving A)
  - **Vested Remainders**:
    - **Definition**: A remainder that is not subject to any condition precedent and has an ascertained taker.
    - **Example**:
      - "To A for life, then to B" (B is a known taker, no condition precedent)

## III. Executory Interests
- **Definition**: A future interest that divests a prior interest upon the occurrence of a condition precedent.
- **Types of Executory Interests**:
  - **Springing Executory Interest**:
    - **Definition**: Divests the transferor.
    - **Example**: "O conveys to C if C graduates law school" (Condition precedent: C graduating law school)
  - **Shifting Executory Interest**:
    - **Definition**: Divests another transferee.
    - **Example**: "O conveys to A, but if A dies before B, then to B" (Condition precedent: A dying before B)

## IV. Analysis of Conveyances
- **Steps for Analyzing Remainders**:
  1. Determine if there is a prior supporting estate.
  2. Identify if there is an ascertainment issue or condition precedent.
  3. Classify the remainder as contingent or vested.
- **Steps for Analyzing Executory Interests**:
  1. Identify the present possessory interest.
  2. Determine if the interest divests the transferor or another transferee.
  3. Classify the executory interest as springing or shifting.

## V. Important Concepts
- **Prior Supporting Estate**: A present possessory interest that supports a remainder.
  - Types include life estates, life estates per autre vie, or leasehold estates.
- **Condition Precedent**: A condition that must occur before an interest can vest.
- **Condition Subsequent**: A condition that can divest an already vested interest.

## VI. Practice and Application
- **Recommendation**: Watch the video multiple times and practice with handout problems and problem sets.
- **Exam Note**: Understanding the distinction between contingent and vested remainders, as well as springing and shifting executory interests, is crucial for exams.

## VII. Conclusion
- **Summary**: Recognizing and correctly labeling future interests is essential for property law.
- **Practice**: Engage with exercises to reinforce understanding of future interests and their classifications.

# Property Law Outline

## I. Introduction to Remainders
- **Definition**: A remainder is a future interest that becomes possessory when a prior estate naturally terminates.
- **Prior Supporting Estate**: 
  - Must exist for a remainder to be valid.
  - Lesser duration than fee simple absolute or defeasible.
  - Must allow for the possibility of vesting upon expiration.

## II. Types of Remainders
- **Contingent Remainders**
  - **Characteristics**:
    - Condition precedent must be met.
    - Potential takers may be unascertained.
  - **Examples**:
    - "To A for life, then to C if C graduates law school."
    - "To A for life, remainder to A's children" (A has no children at conveyance).
  - **Alternate Contingent Remainders**:
    - "To A for life, then to C if C graduates law school, and if not, to D."

- **Vested Remainders**
  - **Characteristics**:
    - At least one known taker.
    - No condition precedent.
  - **Types**:
    1. **Indefeasibly Vested Remainder**:
       - Known taker, no conditions.
       - Example: "To A for life, remainder to B."
    2. **Vested Remainder Subject to Open**:
       - Class gift with at least one member.
       - Example: "To A for life, remainder to B's children" (B has one child).
    3. **Vested Remainder Subject to Complete Divestment**:
       - Condition subsequent could divest interest.
       - Example: "To A for life, remainder to C, but if C fails to survive A, then to B."

## III. Conditions in Remainders
- **Condition Precedent**:
  - Must occur before vesting.
  - Example: "To A for life, then to C if C graduates law school."
- **Condition Subsequent**:
  - Occurs after vesting, can divest interest.
  - Example: "To A for life, then to C, but if C fails to graduate law school, then to D."

## IV. Executory Interests
- **Definition**: Future interest that divests a prior interest or springs from the grantor.
- **Types**:
  - **Shifting Executory Interest**: Divests another transferee.
  - **Springing Executory Interest**: Divests the grantor.

## V. Problem Sets (Flagged for Exams)
- **Purpose**: Test knowledge of future interests.
- **Divisions**:
  - Executory interests.
  - Remainder interests.

## VI. Conclusion
- **Rule Against Perpetuities**: Mentioned as a complex topic in property law.

### Notes:
- **Important Concepts**: Distinction between conditions precedent and subsequent.
- **Exam Focus**: Understanding types of remainders and conditions affecting them.

# Property Outline: Rule Against Perpetuities

## I. Introduction to the Rule Against Perpetuities
- **Purpose**: Limits dead-hand control over property.
- **Common Law Formulation**: No contingent future interest is valid unless it is certain to vest or fail not later than 21 years after a life in being at the creation of the interest.
- **Application**: 
  - Inter vivos conveyance: Analyzed at execution.
  - Testamentary devise: Analyzed at the decedent's death.
- **Invalid Interests**: Void ab initio (from the moment of creation).

## II. Types of Future Interests Subject to the Rule
- **Contingent Future Interests in a Transferee**:
  - Contingent remainders
  - Vested remainders subject to open
  - Executory interests (springing and shifting)
- **Exempt Interests**: 
  - Future interests in a transferor (reversion, possibility of reverter, right of entry).

## III. Analyzing Conveyances Under the Rule
- **Steps for Analysis**:
  1. Identify all contingent future interests in a transferee.
  2. Determine the vesting event for each contingent future interest.
  3. Find a validating life or lives for each vesting event.

## IV. Key Concepts and Tips
- **Validating Life**: Must be causally related to the vesting event.
- **21-Year Period**: Only relevant for conditions involving age or time passage.
- **Practice**: Essential for mastering the rule.

## V. Examples and Application
- **Example 1**: O conveys to A for life, then to A's children for their lives, remainder to B.
  - **Analysis**:
    - A's children: Contingent future interest (contingent remainder or vested remainder subject to open).
    - B: Indefeasibly vested remainder.
    - **Vesting Event**: A's children being born and class closure.
    - **Validating Life**: A (class closes at A's death).
- **Example 2**: O conveys to A for life, then to A's children for their lives, remainder to A's grandchildren.
  - **Analysis**:
    - B (A's child): Vested remainder subject to open.
    - A's grandchildren: Contingent remainder (problematic due to lack of validating life).
    - **Result**: Grandchildren's interest void; conveyance reads to A for life, then to A's children.
- **Example 3**: O conveys to A for life, then to A's children who reach age 21.
  - **Analysis**:
    - B (A's child, age 6): Contingent remainder.
    - **Vesting Event**: Reaching age 21.
    - **Validating Life**: A (all children known at A's death; 21-year period relevant).

## VI. Conclusion
- **Practice**: Applying the rule through examples is crucial.
- **Flexibility**: Use techniques that work best for individual understanding.

# Property Law Outline

## I. Introduction to Estates and Land
- Estates are foundational to real estate practice and estate planning.
- Developed from the English common law system during feudal times.
- Key to mastering terminology is memorization and practice.

## II. Categories of Estates
- **Four Categories in Feudal England:**
  - Fee Simple
  - Fee Tail (no longer recognized in the U.S.)
  - Life Estate
  - Leasehold Estates

- **Focus for Study:**
  - Fee Simple
  - Life Estate
  - Leasehold Tenancies (detailed study in week six)

## III. Present and Future Interests
- **Present Possessory Interests:**
  - Measured in terms of duration.
  
- **Future Interests:**
  - Contingent on certain conditions or events.

## IV. Fee Simple Estates
- **Fee Simple Absolute:**
  - Most complete form of ownership.
  - Unlimited rights, alienable, devisable, and descendable.
  - No conditions or limitations.

- **Fee Simple Defeasible:**
  - Comes with conditions that can affect ownership.
  - Types:
    - **Fee Simple Determinable:**
      - Ends automatically if a condition is breached.
      - Recognizable by durational language (e.g., "so long as," "until").
    - **Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent:**
      - Ownership does not automatically end; original owner must act to reclaim.
      - Condition must be violated for reversion to occur.

## V. Life Estate
- Measured by the life of a person.
- Upon death, property goes to a remainderman or reverts to the original owner/heirs.

## VI. Leasehold Estates
- Temporary right to occupy property.
- Defined by lease terms (e.g., number of years).
- Expires or can be renewed.

## VII. Rule Against Perpetuities
- Important legal principle to prevent interests from being tied up indefinitely.
- **Key to Mastery:**
  - Practice is essential.
  - Important for exams and practical application.

## VIII. Key Terms and Concepts
- **Fee:**
  - Inheritable interest in land.
  - Originates from feudal system terminology.
  
- **Alienable:**
  - Transferable during the owner's lifetime (inter vivos).

- **Devisable:**
  - Transferable through a will.

- **Descendable:**
  - Transferable through intestate succession (when no will is present).

## IX. Conclusion
- Understanding the distinctions between these estates and interests is crucial.
- Practice and application of these principles are necessary for mastery.

# Property Outline

## I. Introduction to Property Interests
- **Present Possessory Interests**: Current ownership or control over property.
- **Future Interests**: Legal rights to property ownership or control that will or may become possessory in the future.

## II. Types of Present Possessory Interests
- **Fee Simple Absolute**: The most complete ownership interest possible.
- **Life Estate**: Ownership for the duration of a person's life.
  - **Measured by Transferee's Life**: e.g., "O conveys to A for life."
  - **Measured by Another's Life (Per Autre Vie)**: e.g., "O conveys to A for the life of B."

## III. Types of Defeasible Fees
- **Fee Simple Determinable**
  - **Characteristics**: 
    - Automatically ends when a condition is violated.
    - Uses durational language (e.g., "so long as," "until").
  - **Example**: "O conveys Greenacre to A, so long as the land is used for farming."
  - **Future Interest**: Possibility of Reverter (held by the transferor).
  - **Key Point**: Automatic forfeiture if the condition is not met.

- **Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent**
  - **Characteristics**: 
    - Does not automatically end upon condition violation.
    - Uses conditional language (e.g., "but if").
  - **Example**: "O conveys Greenacre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, O has the right to reenter."
  - **Future Interest**: Right of Entry or Power of Termination (held by the transferor).
  - **Key Point**: Transferor must exercise the right to reenter.

- **Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation**
  - **Characteristics**: 
    - Automatically divested upon condition violation.
    - Future interest held by a third party (transferee).
  - **Example**: "O conveys Greenacre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, then to C."
  - **Future Interest**: Executory Interest (held by the transferee).
  - **Key Point**: Automatic divestment by the executory interest.

## IV. Future Interests
- **Possibility of Reverter**: 
  - Associated with Fee Simple Determinable.
  - Becomes possessory automatically if the condition is violated.

- **Right of Entry (Power of Termination)**: 
  - Associated with Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent.
  - Requires action by the transferor to become possessory.

- **Executory Interest**: 
  - Associated with Fee Simple Subject to Executory Limitation.
  - Automatically becomes possessory upon condition violation.

- **Reversion**: 
  - Occurs when a transferor conveys a lesser estate than they own.
  - Example: "O conveys to A for life," O retains a reversion.

## V. Key Concepts and Methodology
- **Understanding Future Interests**: 
  - Recognize the type of future interest based on the language of conveyance.
  - Identify whether the future interest is held by the transferor or transferee.
  - Determine if the interest becomes possessory automatically or requires action.

- **Exam Tips**: 
  - Pay attention to the language used in conveyances.
  - Distinguish between automatic and non-automatic divestment.
  - Remember the conditions and who holds the future interest.

## VI. Conclusion
- **Review**: 
  - Recognize the different types of defeasible fees and their characteristics.
  - Understand the relationship between present and future interests.

# Property Outline

## I. Defeasible Fees and Future Interests

### A. Fee Simple Determinable
- **Definition**: A fee simple determinable is a type of defeasible fee that automatically ends when a specified condition occurs.
- **Example**: "O conveys to A so long as A uses the land for farming."
  - A holds a fee simple determinable.
  - O holds a possibility of reverter, which becomes possessory automatically if A ceases farming.

### B. Fee Simple Subject to Condition Subsequent
- **Definition**: A fee simple subject to condition subsequent does not automatically end but gives the original owner the right to reclaim the property if a condition is violated.
- **Example**: "O conveys to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, O has the right to reenter."
  - A holds a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.
  - O holds a right of entry, which must be exercised to reclaim the property.

## II. Future Interests in Transferees

### A. Types of Future Interests
1. **Contingent Remainder**
   - Occurs when the transferee is not ascertainable or the interest is subject to a condition precedent.
   - **Example**: "O conveys to A for life, then to C if C graduates law school."
     - A holds a life estate.
     - C holds a contingent remainder due to the condition precedent of graduating law school.

2. **Vested Remainder**
   - Occurs when the transferee is known and there is no condition precedent.
   - **Example**: "O conveys to A for the life of B, then to C."
     - A holds a life estate per autre vie.
     - C holds a vested remainder.

3. **Executory Interest**
   - Defined as a divesting interest on a condition precedent.
   - **Types**:
     - **Springing Executory Interest**: Divests the transferor.
       - **Example**: "O conveys to C if C graduates law school."
     - **Shifting Executory Interest**: Divests another transferee.
       - **Example**: "O conveys to A, but if A dies before B, then to B."

### B. Analyzing Remainders
- **Step-by-Step Approach**:
  1. Identify the present possessory interest and determine if it qualifies as a prior supporting estate.
  2. Determine if the future interest is a remainder.
  3. Analyze for ascertainment issues and conditions precedent.
  4. Classify the remainder as contingent or vested based on the above analysis.

### C. Examples and Analysis
- **Contingent Remainder**:
  - "O conveys to A for life, then to B if B reaches the age of 25."
    - A holds a life estate.
    - B holds a contingent remainder due to the condition precedent of reaching age 25.
- **Vested Remainder**:
  - "O conveys to A for life, then to B."
    - A holds a life estate.
    - B holds a vested remainder as there is no condition precedent.

## III. Key Concepts and Definitions
- **Future Interest**: A presently existing legal interest where the possibility of possession is future.
- **Condition Precedent**: A condition that must be met before an interest can become possessory.
- **Condition Subsequent**: A condition that can divest an existing interest.

## IV. Important Notes for Exams
- **Flag**: Pay attention to the distinctions between contingent and vested remainders, and between springing and shifting executory interests.
- **Flag**: Understand the operation of conditions precedent and subsequent in the context of future interests.
- **Flag**: Practice analyzing conveyances to identify present possessory interests and classify future interests accurately.

# Property Outline

## I. Introduction to Future Interests
- **Transferee Interests**
  - Executory Interests
  - Remainders
    - Classified as Contingent or Vested

## II. Remainders
- **Definition and Characteristics**
  - Remainders become possessory upon the natural expiration of a prior supporting estate.
  - No vesting condition is required; only the possibility of becoming possessory.

- **Types of Remainders**
  - **Contingent Remainders**
    - Occur when there is an ascertainment issue or a condition precedent.
    - Examples:
      - To A for life, remainder to A's children (A has no children at conveyance).
      - To A for life, remainder to B if B survives A.
  - **Vested Remainders**
    - Known taker, no condition precedent.
    - Types:
      - **Indefeasibly Vested Remainder**
        - Example: To A for life, remainder to B.
      - **Vested Subject to Open**
        - Example: To A for life, remainder to B's children (B is alive with one child).
      - **Vested Subject to Complete Divestment**
        - Example: To A for life, remainder to C, but if C fails to survive A, then to B.

- **Important Note**
  - A remainder can be both subject to open and subject to complete divestment.

## III. Executory Interests
- **Definition and Characteristics**
  - Vest in possession by divesting another interest.
  - Condition serves as the vesting event.

- **Types of Executory Interests**
  - **Springing Executory Interest**
    - Divests a transferor.
    - Example: O conveys to C if C graduates law school.
  - **Shifting Executory Interest**
    - Divests another transferee.
    - Example: O conveys to A, but if C graduates law school, then to C.

## IV. Prior Supporting Estates
- **Definition and Characteristics**
  - Must be of lesser duration than a fee simple absolute or defeasible.
  - Examples:
    - Life Estate
    - Life Estate per autre vie
    - Term of Years (Leasehold Estate)

## V. Conditions in Future Interests
- **Condition Precedent vs. Condition Subsequent**
  - **Condition Precedent**
    - Must occur before vesting.
    - Example: O conveys to A for life, then to C, if C graduates law school.
  - **Condition Subsequent**
    - Occurs after vesting, can divest the interest.
    - Example: To A for life, remainder to C, but if C fails to survive A, then to B.

## VI. Key Points for Exams
- **Distinguishing Conditions**
  - Must the condition happen before or after to vest possession?
  - Precedent: Must happen before vesting.
  - Subsequent: Operates to divest possession.

- **Recognizing Remainder Types**
  - Contingent: Unascertained takers or condition precedent.
  - Vested: Known takers, no condition precedent.

- **Understanding Executory Interests**
  - Springing vs. Shifting based on who is divested.

- **Exam Strategy**
  - Focus on identifying the type of interest and any conditions attached.
  - Pay attention to whether conditions are precedent or subsequent.

This outline highlights the main topics, subtopics, and key details necessary for understanding property interests, particularly focusing on remainders and executory interests, which are crucial for exams.

# Property Outline

## I. Future Interests and Conditions

### A. Contingent Remainders
- **Definition**: A remainder that depends on a condition precedent.
- **Example**: "To A for life, then to C if C graduates law school."
  - C has a contingent remainder.
- **Alternate Contingent Remainders**: 
  - **Example**: "To A for life, then to C if C graduates law school, and if C does not graduate law school, to D."
    - C and D have alternate contingent remainders.
    - Vesting depends on the occurrence or non-occurrence of the same condition.

### B. Executory Interests
- **Springing Executory Interest**: 
  - **Example**: "O conveys to C if C graduates law school."
    - C has a springing executory interest.
    - Divests O of O's fee simple subject to executory limitation.
- **Shifting Executory Interest**: 
  - **Example**: "O conveys to A, but if C graduates law school, then to C."
    - C has a shifting executory interest.
    - Divests A upon the occurrence of the condition subsequent.

### C. Vested Remainders
- **Vested Remainder Subject to Divestment**: 
  - **Example**: "O conveys to A for life, then to C. But if C fails to graduate law school, then to D."
    - C has a vested remainder subject to divestment.
    - D holds the shifting executory interest.

## II. Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP)

### A. Purpose and Definition
- **Purpose**: Limits deadhand control over property.
- **Common Law Rule**: No contingent future interest is valid unless it is certain to vest or fail within 21 years after a life in being at the creation of the interest.

### B. Application
- **Timing**: 
  - Inter vivos conveyance: Analyzed at execution.
  - Testamentary devise: Analyzed at decedent's death.
- **Void Interests**: If an interest fails the rule, it is void ab initio (from the moment it was created).

### C. Types of Interests Subject to RAP
- **Contingent Future Interests**: 
  - Includes contingent remainders, vested remainders subject to open, and executory interests.
- **Exclusions**: 
  - Future interests in a transferor (reversion, possibility of reverter, right of entry) are not subject to RAP.

### D. Analyzing for RAP
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify all contingent future interests in a transferee.
  2. Determine the vesting event for each interest.
  3. Find a validating life or lives for each vesting event.
- **Validating Life**: Must be causally related to the vesting event.

### E. Practical Tips
- **21-Year Rule**: Only relevant for conditions involving age or time passage.
- **Practice**: Understanding RAP requires analyzing examples and practice.

## III. Examples and Analysis

### A. Example 1
- **Conveyance**: "O conveys to A for life, then to A's children for their lives, remainder to B."
  - **Analysis**:
    - A has a life estate.
    - A's children have a contingent remainder.
    - B has an indefeasibly vested remainder.
  - **RAP**: A is a validating life; interests are valid.

### B. Example 2
- **Conveyance**: "O conveys to A for life, then to A's children for their lives, remainder to A's grandchildren."
  - **Analysis**:
    - B (A's child) has a vested remainder subject to open.
    - A's grandchildren have a contingent remainder.
  - **RAP**: 
    - A is a validating life for B's interest.
    - A's grandchildren's interest is problematic; no validating life identified.

**Note**: Pay attention to the Rule Against Perpetuities as it is often emphasized in exams and legal practice. Practice analyzing conveyances with RAP in mind to develop confidence and understanding.

# Property Law Outline

## I. Rule Against Perpetuities (RAP)
- **Definition**: Legal rule that prevents interests in property from vesting too far into the future.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Validating Lives**: Closed class required for ascertainment of identity.
  - **Void Interests**: If an interest is void under RAP, it is void ab initio (from the beginning).
  - **Striking Void Interests**: Any void interest must be removed from the conveyance.

- **Examples**:
  1. **Example 1**:
     - Conveyance: "To A for life, then to A's children for their lives, remainder to A's grandchildren."
     - Issue: Class of A's children is open; no validating lives.
     - Result: Remainder to A's grandchildren is void.
     - State of Title: A has a life estate; B has a vested remainder subject to open; O has a reversion.

  2. **Example 2**:
     - Scenario Change: A pre-deceased T.
     - Result: Class of A's children is closed; contingent future interest in grandchildren can vest.
     - State of Title: Valid contingent remainder in A's grandchildren.

  3. **Example 3**:
     - Conveyance: "O conveys to A for life, then to A's children who reach age 21."
     - Analysis:
       - B has a contingent remainder (must reach age 21).
       - Validating Life: A (at A's death, all children known).
     - State of Title: A has a life estate; B has a contingent remainder; O has a reversion.

- **Practice**: Emphasized as crucial for mastering RAP.

## II. Concurrent Ownership (Co-Tenancies)
- **Types of Ownership**:
  - **Inseveralty**: Sole and exclusive possession by one owner.
  - **Consecutive Ownership**: Divided among present and future interest holders.
  - **Concurrent Ownership**: Concurrent rights of present or future possession.

- **Key Feature**: Each tenant has a possessory right to the undivided whole.

- **Types of Co-Tenancies**:
  1. **Tenancy by the Entirety**:
     - Requires all five unities (time, title, interest, possession, person).
     - Exists only between married persons.
     - Right of survivorship: Surviving spouse holds title in severalty.

  2. **Joint Tenancy**:
     - Requires four unities (time, title, interest, possession).
     - Right of survivorship: Surviving joint tenants hold the estate.
     - Can be created between any two persons.

  3. **Tenancy in Common**:
     - Requires only unity of possession.
     - No right of survivorship.
     - Interests can be unequal and acquired at different times.

- **Creation of Co-Tenancies**:
  - **Unities of Title**: TIP (Time, Title, Interest, Possession, Person).
  - **Language**: Specific language required to create joint tenancies and tenancies by the entirety.
  - **Presumptions**: Modern presumption favors tenancy in common unless specific language indicates otherwise.

- **Rights and Limitations**:
  - **Conveyance**:
    - Tenancy by the Entirety: No unilateral conveyance.
    - Joint Tenancy: Unilateral conveyance possible.
    - Tenancy in Common: Unilateral conveyance possible.

- **Important Note**: Drafting clarity is essential to reflect the client's intentions accurately.

This outline provides a structured overview of key concepts in property law, focusing on the Rule Against Perpetuities and concurrent ownership. It highlights important examples, rules, and drafting considerations.

# Property Law Outline

## I. Co-Tenancy Types and Characteristics

### A. Joint Tenancy
- **Creation and Severance**
  - Can be unilaterally conveyed by a joint tenant.
  - **Consequence of Conveyance**: 
    - Destroys the right of survivorship for the severing tenant.
    - Gains certainty of fractional share value but loses potential to inherit the whole.
- **Termination**
  - **Unilateral Severance**: 
    - If only two joint tenants, severance ends the joint tenancy.
    - If more than two, remaining tenants maintain joint tenancy with survivorship rights.
  - **Partition**:
    - Voluntary: Joint tenants divide property in kind or sell and divide proceeds.
    - Judicial: Court-ordered partition in kind or sale if disagreement arises.
    - **Case Reference**: Delfino case examines partition issues.

### B. Tenancy in Common
- **Conveyance**
  - All tenants may unilaterally convey their fractional interests.
- **Termination**
  - **Partition**: 
    - Can be voluntary or judicial.
    - Each tenant holds an undivided interest.

### C. Tenancy by the Entirety
- **Creation and Termination**
  - Cannot be unilaterally severed by either spouse.
  - Termination requires mutual written agreement, divorce, or execution by a joint creditor.
- **Advantages**
  - Not vulnerable to liabilities of one spouse alone.
  - Execution requires a joint creditor.

## II. Rights and Duties of Co-Tenants

### A. Sharing Benefits
- **Rent or Value from Third Parties**
  - Co-tenants share in proportion to their fractional interests.
- **Profits from Co-Tenant's Labor or Sole Possession**
  - No right to share unless agreement exists or co-tenants are ousted.
  - Exception for depletion of natural resources.

### B. Sharing Burdens
- **Taxes and Governmental Obligations**
  - Co-tenants must share absent an agreement to the contrary.
- **Mortgage Payments**
  - Shared responsibility.
- **Repairs and Improvements**
  - **Repairs**:
    - Traditional: No sharing required; credit given upon sale or accounting.
    - Modern: Contribution possible if repair is necessary and notice is given.
  - **Improvements**:
    - No contribution required.
    - Improving tenant entitled to appreciated value or responsible for diminution.

## III. Remedies for Co-Tenants

### A. Accounting
- Action to collect share of benefits, such as rents from third parties.

### B. Contribution
- Action to collect share of costs, such as taxes or mortgage payments.

### C. Waste
- Action for damage to property interest due to actions or inaction of co-tenants.

### D. Partition
- Action to separate interests or terminate co-tenancy.

## IV. Application and Examples

### A. Joint Tenancy Example
- A, B, and C hold Blackacre as joint tenants; C conveys interest to D.
  - Result: A and B remain joint tenants with two-thirds interest; D is a tenant in common with one-third interest.

### B. Tenancy in Common Example
- A, B, and C hold Blackacre as tenants in common; C conveys interest to D.
  - Result: A, B, and D each hold an undivided one-third interest as tenants in common.

## V. Test Your Knowledge
- **Note**: Attempt the multiple-choice questions posted to assess understanding.
