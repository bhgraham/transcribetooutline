of future interests. The contingent remainder, the vested remainder, and the executory interest.
A contingent remainder occurs when the transferee is either not ascertainable,
or the vesting is subject to a condition precedent, or possibly both. With a vested remainder,
you know who the transferee is, and there is no condition precedent. The executory interest is
defined as a divesting interest on a condition precedent. Now, I realize that this all just
sounds like definitions, and that you need something more concrete to be able to recognize
these interests when they appear in a conveyance. I'm now going to give you a step-by-step approach
to help you do that. Let's look first at remainders. If you recall, the general classification of
remainders includes both contingent remainders and vested remainders. In either category, to be a
remainder, there must be something for the remainder to remain after. That something is a prior
supporting estate in a transferee. That will be the present possessory interest. A prior supporting
estate must be a lesser estate than a fee simple absolute or a fee simple defeasible. Why? Because
a fee simple absolute or fee simple defeasible is of potentially infinite duration. In order to be a
prior supporting estate, it must be possible for a remainder to become possessory at the natural
expiration of that estate. Let's look at some examples that illustrate the concept of a prior
supporting estate. In our first conveyance, O conveys to A for life, then to C if C graduates law
school. We look for the present possessory interest, and that is a life estate in A. What remains after
is a contingent remainder in C, which contains the condition precedent if C graduates law school.
It is possible in this conveyance that at the natural expiration of A's life estate, in other
words, at A's death, that C's remainder interest could become possessory if in fact C has graduated
law school. In the next conveyance, to A for the life of B, then to C, what C has is a vested
remainder. We know who C is, and there is no condition precedent. The prior supporting estate to A for the
life of B is a life estate per autra B, a life estate measured by the life of B. At the natural conclusion
of that life estate per autra B, C's vested remainder will become possessory. In the third example, to A for five
years, then to B's children, what A has is a term of years. We haven't studied this yet. It is one of
the leasehold estates. Then to B's children is a remainder, and what type of remainder it is depends
on facts that are not apparent on the face of this conveyance. If B is dead and all of B's children
are known, then it's a vested remainder. If B is alive and has no children yet, it's a contingent
remainder because we have an ascertainment issue. Now for the sake of comparison and contrast, let's
consider examples where there is no prior supporting estate for the transferee's future
interest. In the first example, O conveys to C if C graduates law school. Note, O has retained the
present possessory interest, and if C graduates law school, C's future interest divests O's present
possessory interest. In the next example, O conveys to A, but if A dies before B, then to B. In this
example, it's a transferee that has the present possessory interest, but note if A dies before B,
A's interest is actually divested, and B's interest becomes vested in possession. So rather than there
being a present possessory estate in a transferee, that concludes at the natural expiration of the
estate, in this instance, A has a fee symbol subject to executory limitation that could be of infinite
duration. But if the condition subsequent happens, A dying before B, then B's interest, which we call
an executory interest, shifts and divests A. So in these examples, we do not have remainders, we have
executory interests, and as we'll see later in this video, the interest to C in our first example is also
an executory interest, but it behaves differently than the one in B in our second example. What is
the difference? The executory interest in C will divest the transfer or, whereas the executory
interest in B divests another transferee. When analyzing a conveyance that contains a future
interest in a transferee, I recommend that you first analyze it to determine whether the interest is a
remainder. Let's look at this example. To A for life, then to B if B reaches the age of 25. The first
question you should ask is, where is the present possessory interest, and does it qualify as a
prior supporting estate? The answer to the first question in this example is yes. The present
possessory interest is a life estate in A, and it qualifies as a prior supporting estate. Once we know
that we have a prior supporting estate, we also know that what follows is a remainder interest in the
transferee. Now we have to determine what kind of remainder interest. I recommend that you next look
at whether there is an ascertainment issue and whether there is a condition precedent.
In this particular example, there is not an ascertainment issue because we know the taker.
The taker is B. However, when we look at the language of the conveyance, we see that there
is a condition precedent. What is a condition precedent? A condition that must happen before
the taker's interest vests in possession. The condition precedent in this conveyance is B reaching
the age of 25. Because there is a condition precedent and there was a prior supporting estate,
B has a remainder known as a contingent remainder.
Let's look at another example. In this conveyance, O conveys to A for life, then to B. Of course,
our first question is do we have a prior supporting estate? The answer is yes, we have a life estate
in A, that is the present possessory interest, and it qualifies as a prior supporting estate.
Next, we analyze to determine whether this is a contingent remainder. Remember that the two
questions we ask are whether there's an ascertainment issue and whether there is a condition precedent.
In this conveyance, the answer to both questions is no. B is a known taker, and there is no
condition precedent to B's interest vesting. Thus, what B has is a remainder known
as a vested remainder.
Now that you have the general guidelines for distinguishing a contingent remainder from a
vested remainder, it's time to take a closer look at both of these categories to understand the
different types of contingent remainders and vested remainders that can occur. In the category of
contingent remainders, any one of three circumstances will yield a contingent remainder, either an
ascertainment issue, a condition precedent, or both. The example to A for life, remainder to A's children,
the remainder to A's children is contingent because at the time of the conveyance we're told
that A has no children, and thus we have an ascertainment issue. In the second example,
to A for life, remainder to B if B survives A, the remainderman B is ascertained. However,
there is a condition precedent. In order for B's remainder to vest, there is a condition precedent
that B survives A. In the last example, to A for life, remainder to A's children who survive A,
we have both circumstances, both an ascertainment issue and a condition precedent. We're told that at
the time of the conveyance, A has no children, which is the ascertainment issue, and there is also a
condition precedent that those children, if A has any, must survive A for that remainder to vest.
Now let's return to the examples where there is no prior supporting estate for the transferee's
future interest. These are known as executory interests. In the example O conveys to C if C
graduates law school, the present possessory interest is retained in O, and the interest in C
is known not only as an executory interest, but as a springing executory interest. In the second example,
O conveys to A, but if A dies before B, then to B, the present possessory interest in A is known as a
fee symbol, subject to executory limitation, and B's interest is known as a shifting executory interest.
The definition of an executory interest is that it is a divesting interest on a condition
precedent. Now I just mentioned that there are two types of executory interests, springing and
shifting. It's fairly easy to see from our two examples how an executory interest is a divesting
interest. So it becomes possessory not at the natural expiration of a prior supporting estate,
it becomes possessory by divesting another present possessory interest, either a present possessory
interest in the transferee or a present possessory interest in a transferee. It's a springing
executory interest when it springs back and divests a transferee, and it's a shifting executory interest
when it shifts over and divests another transferee. Now the definition, a divesting interest on a
condition precedent, many students find confusing. Let's look at the more straightforward example of
this. O conveys to C if C graduates law school. If we look at the wording to C if C graduates law
school, the wording if C graduates law school looks like a condition precedent. So it's easy to
understand in that example how the springing executory interest is a divesting interest on a
condition precedent. What becomes confusing is the circumstance of the shifting executory interest,
and why is that so? If we look at the conveyance O conveys to A, but if A dies before B, then to B,
what we recognize in that conveyance is the condition subsequent. We learned when we study the feasible
fees that this is a fee simple subject to executory limitation because of that condition subsequent,
but if A dies before B. So if this conveyance contains a condition subsequent, how can we say
that the shifting executory interest is a divesting interest on a condition precedent? Here's the
answer. When we label interest, we always go from left to right, but if A dies before B is called a
condition subsequent because it refers to the preceding interest, that defeasible fee in A. It's the
condition that happens after that can divest A's fee simple subject to executory limitation.
But consider that same condition, but if A dies before B, while it operates as a condition subsequent
that can take away, divest A's interest, that same condition operates as a condition precedent to B's
shifting executory interest vesting. However, the label is condition subsequent because it refers to
the preceding interest. So while we never call that a condition precedent in the operation of B's
shifting executory interest, what B has is a divesting interest on a condition precedent. The condition
subsequent that takes the interest away from A and vests it in B. Congratulations, you've now learned
all of the basic rules to recognize and work with future interests. I recommend that you watch this
video several times.
