In our last discussion, we learned about the different sources of legal authority, and
we learned that the pool of available legal authorities is vast.
At the same time, we know that our mission for a research assignment is to locate primary,
mandatory authority for our legal issue.
We learned that the first step of any legal research assignment is to develop a research
plan.
We learned that if you craft a thoughtful research plan at the outset, the research becomes
less intimidating because your plan will help you hone in on the legal issue as well
as the body of law you will need to search to find your answer.
And now that you have these details in place, you're likely eager to begin your search.
Today we will discuss the second step in a research assignment, consulting secondary sources
to address your issue.
But before we talk about the next step in the legal research process, let's take a couple
of minutes to discuss how and where legal information is published and retrieved.
Before you dive into your research, it's important to understand how legal information is published
and stored.
Most, if not all, of the authorities you will research are available from a variety of sources.
They may be published in print, electronically, or both.
Regardless of where it is found, keep in mind that legal information is typically organized
by type of authority, jurisdiction, and source of law.
As you can imagine, secondary sources or commentary on the law are printed in their own volumes separate
and apart from primary authorities.
Furthermore, different sources of law from different jurisdictions are printed in different compiled
volumes of books.
For example, let's say you want to find a court opinion from Pennsylvania.
You will find court opinions from Pennsylvania in one set of books, called reporters, while
Pennsylvania statutes would be found in a compiled volume of a different set of books.
And if you wanted to pull a court opinion from Arizona, you would visit a different set
of reporters than those housing the Pennsylvania court opinions.
Electronic research tools are organized similarly.
Some sources, like the United States Supreme Court website, will provide access to only one
source of law from one jurisdiction.
In this example, Supreme Court opinions, which are the court opinions from the highest court in
the federal system.
Other services provide access to a wide range of authorities.
Those that do typically subdivide their contents, much like the print sources, into individual
databases organized by type, jurisdiction, and source.
Retrieving legal authority.
In practice, you will be able to find print sources in a few different places depending on
the type.
Many law firms and organizations have collections of print sources from the jurisdiction commonly
practiced in.
For example, when I practiced law in a law firm, we had reporters with state court opinions on
the shelves in our firm.
We also had the state statutes in print.
Furthermore, you can often access print sources from a local law school or courthouse.
In today's age, however, many legal authorities are widely accessible online.
The content and reliability of each site varies.
For the most part, lawyers consult specialized search engines to complete their research.
At the top end of the commercial legal research market are Westlaw and Lexis Advance, which have
been around for decades and are designed to meet the needs of researchers across jurisdictions
and topic areas.
Both have a good variety of primary and secondary sources.
A recent new player into this sphere is Bloomberg, which strengths lie in its business and news
platforms.
All of the top end research services feature a breadth of sources and sophisticated search algorithms
to support search processing.
Other legal research platforms, including FastCase and Casemaker, have less content and fewer
bells and whistles than the higher-end services.
Nevertheless, you may find yourself using them for specific content while you are a student
with us or at some point in your career.
While you are students at Syracuse Law, you have free access to the big three services, Lexis
Advanced, Westlaw, and Bloomberg.
Because we all have common access to the commercial sites, our video lectures in the coming weeks will focus on electronic
research and specifically research in Westlaw and Lexis Advance.
While Bloomberg is certainly a new and big player in the marketplace, the other two services have
time-tested reliability and offer the breadth of sources we will need for our searches.
Nevertheless, I encourage you to visit all of the services at different times for different
purposes so you can get a sense as to the range of options available and the functionality of each.
Furthermore, print versions of legal sources have had a massive impact on the research process and
therefore I will, from time to time, reference them.
Print sources are by no means obsolete.
If you know that you will utilize print sources or otherwise have a particular interest in learning
about conducting research in print, check your textbook.
You can also speak with your professor, who should be able to direct you to additional resources
in this regard.
Now that you have a well-crafted research plan, it's time to get started on your research.
The second step in your research process is to consult secondary sources.
As you recall, secondary sources are not the law.
Instead, they provide commentary on the law.
Since you know that your mission for your research project will be to locate primary, mandatory authority
on your issue, you may be wondering why consulting secondary sources is the second step on the list.
Why we use them
Have you ever consulted a study guide for class, whether here in law school or for your undergraduate
education, something that helps to explain the overlay of the subject in a more succinct and relatable way?
As you tackle an entire subject, perhaps you find the study guide, now or in the past, would be giving
you a big picture view of the topic area and how all of the pieces work together. A secondary source
can serve the same purpose.
Furthermore, have you ever read a document that uses a lot of technical jargon or lingo,
perhaps a manual or an insurance policy, and then, because it was not exactly clear,
you searched for the document on the web in the hopes that you could find a summary of what you just read?
Similarly, a secondary source can take a single document or a slice of a subject area and explain
the small details beautifully and in a way that could take you hours to understand on your own.
Finally, another advantage of a secondary source is that it will direct you to primary sources for your
area in your jurisdiction. They will provide you mandatory authority in a relatable, understandable way.
You can then use these references to pull the primary authorities. And as you will see,
having a primary source citation can help you narrow your search and pool of available sources exponentially.
With that said, if you are already familiar with the area of law you are researching, you may skip this step.
But if the area of law is new or unfamiliar to you, my unequivocal recommendation is that you save time and
frustration. Start with a secondary source. What they are. So now that we've established some reasons to
consult secondary sources. While these sources are all available, keep in mind that the usefulness of a
particular secondary source depends upon the governing law and your client's legal issues and facts.
Keep going to be how exciting works.

Treatise
A treatise is a single book or multi-volume section that provide you mandatory authority
in a relatable, understandable way.
You can then use these references to pull the primary authorities.
And as you will see, having a primary source citation can help you narrow your search and
pool of available sources exponentially.
With that said, if you are already familiar with the area of law you are researching, you
may skip this step.
But if the area of law is new or unfamiliar to you, my unequivocal recommendation is that
you save time and frustration.
Start with a secondary source.
What they are
So now that we've established some reasons to consult secondary sources, let's talk
about common examples of the characteristics of each.
While these sources are all available, keep in mind that the usefulness of a particular
secondary source depends upon the governing law and your client's legal issues and facts.
Legal Encyclopedias
The first source we'll discuss is Legal Encyclopedias.
Legal Encyclopedias are similar to traditional multi-volume set encyclopedias you may have used
in grade school, except that they are limited in scope to legal subjects.
They are a great way to get general background information on an area of law, and they are typically
organized alphabetically by topic.
There are two national encyclopedias, American Jurisprudence 2nd Edition, Amjur 2nd, and Corpus
Juris Secundum, CJS.
Both of these address and provide citations to federal and state laws.
If you are researching state law, you will want to see if the particular state has its own
legal encyclopedia, as it would contain summaries and primary source references for just that state.
Examples include New York Jurisprudence, Maryland Law Encyclopedia, and Michigan Law in Practice.
Treatise
A treatise is a single book or multi-volume set of books that have a narrower focus than legal
encyclopedias.
While legal encyclopedias give a general overview of a broad range of topics, treatises provide
in-depth treatment of a single subject, like torts or contracts.
Not only will it provide a general state of the law for all of the major topics in that
subject area, a treatise may discuss the history of the development of the law in that area,
analyze the relationship of subjects to one another, and discuss policy reasons for the
rules.
An example includes Dobbs' Law of Torts, 2nd.
Practice Manual
A practice manual will provide a detailed analysis of an area of law in a specific court or jurisdiction.
These differ from treatises in one primary respect.
They focus on practical applications of the law and often include tools for practicing attorneys,
like sample complaints or a checklist for filing a matter at court.
Practice manuals are usually written by practitioners or scholars specializing in that jurisdiction.
They are organized by topic and can be one volume or many.
An example is Texas Practice Contract Law
American Law Reports, ALR
American Law Reports, or ALR, is a huge multi-volume set of books full of articles called annotations.
The annotations provide a summary of law on a narrow topic in depth, as well as a table of relevant
primary authorities organized by jurisdiction, which can be quick references for finding authority
across jurisdictions.
These are especially helpful at the beginning of your research to give you an overview of a topic.
The ALR books are available for federal law, and there's also a compilation covering the states.
Legal Periodicals
The final source I will touch on is Legal Periodicals.
These are sources that provide a collection of articles discussing the law.
This includes law reviews and commercially available legal magazines.
Law review articles are thoughtful treatments of legal issues written by law professors, judges, practitioners, and even students.
They generally provide in-depth treatment on a single subject, though they sometimes include background,
which gives a general overview of the topic that can be helpful.
Commercially published magazines, such as the National ABA Journal, and local bar journals and newspapers,
such as the Los Angeles Lawyer Magazine, are legal magazines published by state or local bar associations,
which are written by practitioners or judges practicing in that area.
These provide short articles, which are focused more on describing legal developments than on analysis.
Chapter 8 of your textbook discusses other secondary sources, including restatements, loose-leaf services,
uniform acts and model codes, and jury instructions.
You will likely use different secondary sources at different times throughout your career,
and I encourage you to become familiar with them.
The key for you at this point is to know that they exist and be able to recognize them for what they are.
Secondary sources.
As I've mentioned, novice legal researchers can mistake secondary sources for primary,
a mistake you don't want to make because secondary sources are never mandatory for your issue.
Now that we've covered a handful of secondary sources in some detail,
see if you can identify the answers to the following questions.
Thank you.
Thank you.
How to research them.
As you can imagine, secondary sources are available in either print or online.
If you are planning to perform research within a secondary source using books,
and you are lucky enough to have the citation you need to access,
you would just go to the correct source and page.
If not, your first step would be to identify which of the print sources are available to you,
and which ones will be most helpful to you as you research your topic.
Most secondary sources, other than legal periodicals,
have indexes at the back of their volumes, which are organized by subject,
and then, within each larger topic area, subtopic.
If you know which subject you want to research,
you would then go to the index and look it up to find the references to that subject within the larger text.
Start by using some of the search terms that you identified in your research plan as you search for your subject.
You could also scan the table of contents, if available, in the beginning of each relevant subject volume.
If you plan to research secondary sources online, you are in luck.
Many of the referenced secondary sources are available on the major legal research platforms.
Secondary source material can be retrieved in a few different ways from the online legal research platforms.
You can retrieve a document directly if you have its citation.
You can browse the sources by type or subject.
Or you can perform a keyword search.
Search by citation.
First, as always, you can retrieve the document from an online source if you have the relevant citation.
You would merely enter the citation into the search bar of the research site and hit go or enter.
You would not need to apply any of the filters as long as the citation is relatively strongly constructed.
In that case, the search engine will recognize the source for what it is and immediately pull open the document.
Search by type or subject.
Furthermore, even if you don't have a citation, you can find secondary sources by browsing the secondary source by type or subject area.
If you are going to search by type, start by identifying the relevant jurisdiction you want to search and filter your secondary source options through that.
Let's go back to our example problem from last week to see how this works.
As you may recall, we have a client, Claudia Jackson, who wants to know if she can hold her landlord liable for breach of the warranty of habitability in Missouri.
Since I'm not familiar with the topic, I would want to start my research by consulting secondary sources first.
To browse through the secondary sources available for Missouri law using West law, you would first click on the state materials tab from the home page.
Click on Missouri, scroll down and click on All Missouri Secondary Sources from the next screen to view a list of all secondary sources covering Missouri law.
The process is similar in Lexis from the home screen, select the state tab to view a list of all states, click on Missouri, and then scroll down and click All Missouri Treatises, Practice Guides, and Jurisprudence to see the list of Missouri Secondary Sources.
Once you are in this database of sources, you can click on one of the sources and browse the topic areas available within it.
Or you could perform a keyword search of one or all of the secondary sources in this database.
We'll discuss this process in just a few minutes.
Furthermore, another way to search secondary sources is by general subject area.
If you want a broad overview of an area of law, generally, that's not specific to one jurisdiction, you can browse secondary sources by subject area in either West law or Lexis.
Both of these platforms have categorized their secondary sources by over 40 topics, such as contracts law, criminal law, and real property law.
To navigate to this screen, you would start from the main screen and click Secondary Sources.
Then scroll down and click on the topic area in West law or practice area in Lexis.
If you click on the topic area, you would then have to drill down through sub-subjects until you find the topic you are looking for.
If you browse the secondary sources available on both West law and Lexis, you will see that they vary widely because they each produce or own publishers that produce different titles.
I encourage you to utilize more than one platform when you conduct your secondary search so you can get a sense of the variety of materials available on each.
Another method by which to search secondary sources in either of the major online research platforms is through keyword search.
A keyword search is a simple process that consists of typing terms into a search bar and then scanning through the results.
The terms used may be as simple as a single word or as complex as a complete sentence.
No matter which service you use, there are generally two methods to complete a keyword search.
Through a natural language search or a terms and connectors search.
Natural language search.
If you have ever used Google or another popular search engine, you are familiar with the natural language search.
This is where you just enter a term or phrase and the search engine does the work for you,
returning a set of documents it believes are relevant to your question or search.
Similarly, through conducting a natural language search on one of the major legal research platforms,
you are relying on the search engine's algorithm to read the words you've entered and produce relevant information.
This is often a good place for you to start in a search engine because it will generally return many results
and push general, frequently cited sources toward the top of your results.
However, keep in mind that natural language searches often also return thousands of results,
or results not precise enough for a legal researcher.
For this demo, let's go back to our research text and review the question presented there for the research problem.
Under North Carolina law, does the illegality defense prevent a court from enforcing a partnership agreement
where the partnership was not created for an illegal purpose,
but the partners later engaged in illegal acts in performing the business affairs of the partnership?
Let's say we'd like to launch a keyword search for this question
because we know nothing about partnerships and the illegality defense in North Carolina.
Before we enter our keywords,
we'll want to be sure we've filtered out
into our search for the correct databases
so we can ensure our search is sufficiently narrowed to the pool of relevant authority for our issue.
This includes selecting the relevant jurisdiction,
North Carolina,
and or the type of authority or document you want to search.
Here, secondary sources.
Just remember,
any time you perform a keyword search
in the major commercial service platforms,
you must double-check your database selections
to ensure you've adequately narrowed your pool of sources.
So, returning to our question,
let's say we formulate a natural language search
of contract illegality defense
to start
or perhaps even more specific
partnership agreement illegality defense.
Take a break
and go run the searches identified in either Westlaw or Lexis
and see how many sources you come up with.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I ran this search, both searches returned over 10,000 results for me in Westlaw.
In Lexis Advance, the numbers were more manageable.
For Contract Illegality Defense, I got around 579 hits.
For Partnership Agreement Illegality Defense, I got 19 results.
Because that seems like a reasonable number, I would probably start there.
But for those of you who got 10,000 results on Westlaw, or even 500-plus results on Lexis Advance, that may have felt overwhelming.
You will have a lot of results to sift through.
Furthermore, don't forget, anytime you are running a natural language search, you are relying on the search algorithm to return and order the results it believes are the most relevant.
What if the most helpful authority is actually number 472 on the list?
Terms and Connectors Search
Well, a Terms and Connectors Search, or Boolean Search, is also available.
Through this process, a legal researcher can take greater control of her search by specifying which exact words the document should or should not contain,
as well as the words' relationships to one another.
Running a Terms and Connectors Search is a great way to narrow your search if you find you've gotten too many results.
And furthermore, depending on how you craft your search, it may produce results that are much more precise.
To run a Terms and Connectors Search, you specify the relationship through logical symbols or operators,
because they operate upon the basic search function to modify the forced algorithm.
You can usually find a list of the available operators by clicking on the Advanced Search link,
which is found at or near the top of the right corner of the search bar in both Westlaw and Lexis Advance.
Remember that if you run a Terms and Connectors Search, you want to make sure you capture all variations of the terms
to ensure that you don't unnecessarily narrow your search.
Using the OR feature, the asterisk, or the exclamation point root expander
will help you to broaden the search beyond initial search terms you may have used.
So let's try an example.
Using the same contract illegality problem referenced before, we could build a more specific Terms and Connectors Search
for North Carolina secondary sources using the following operators.
The translation of this search is that the document must contain the word contract or agreement,
and that term must appear within the same paragraph as a word that has illegal as its root,
which must appear within the same sentence as a word that has perform at its root.
Again, a key step before running this search will be to select the relevant jurisdiction and source.
Here, choose North Carolina and secondary sources.
Take a minute to run this search in Westlaw or Lexis Advance and check out your results.
When I ran the search in Westlaw, I returned 30 results.
In Lexis, I had 29 results.
This is much more manageable than our initial natural language search.
You can always modify your operators and terms to further expand or narrow your search.
I encourage you to utilize both natural language and Terms and Connectors searches
and experiment with the different operators as you construct searches.
Conveniently, note that any time you incorporate operators into your search,
the search bar will generally recognize the search as a Terms and Connectors search.
If your search bar contains only words and no operators,
then the search engine will default to a natural language search
and utilize the built-in algorithm to determine the results it believes are the most relevant.
Now that you know the two different search methods for searching the typical legal search engines,
it's time to put your knowledge into practice.
Take a few minutes to complete the following exercise before you move on.

Hopefully you found some helpful information as a result of your search.
I ran a natural language search in both search engines using implied warranty of habitability
as my phrase.
I also ran a terms and connectors search that limited the number of results I received.
There's no exactly right answer to the terms you would use to search.
It's a matter of trial and error.
The key is that through your searches you begin to feel comfortable with your grasp on
the law.
For example, you should have determined through your search that there is indeed a claim for
warranty of habitability and its breach in Missouri.
In Lexis, I found a helpful publication of the Missouri Bar called Missouri Tort Law
Section 13.47, which talked about the ways a tenant could utilize the warranty of habitability
and included some references to Missouri case law.
I also found a great breakdown of the cause of action, including potential elements, on Westlaw
under 36 Missouri Practice Series Section 23.3.
It even provided me with that four-element test and a case site for that test, Keodini v. Fox.
Make sure you get in the habit now of taking good notes on your research trail.
You will want to make note of search terms you used, sources you consulted, and relevant
material from each.
The good news is that the major legal research platforms track your research history and
the documents you viewed, typically for a period of several months.
These are found under the History tab toward the top right of your screen on the research platforms.
While you should certainly use these to refresh your recollection, and for moments where you
may not have taken copious notes, get into the habit now of tracking your search terms, documents
retrieved, and the information gleaned therefrom.
This will save you time and headaches in the long run.
At some point during your secondary source search, you will feel as though you have a pretty good
overview of the subject area.
With that said, remember to never rely on a secondary source's analysis of a primary authority.
You must always review the underlying primary authorities and conduct your own analysis, relevant
to the facts of the issue you are researching.
Once you feel like you have a good enough grasp on the material and a solid lead on relevant
primary sources, you will be ready to move on to step three of the research process, drafting
a preliminary outline and beginning your primary authority research.
If all has gone well in your secondary source research, you should have a good background
of the law on your legal question.
You should even have some primary authorities to consult as you move along in your research.
But before you move on to pull those primary authorities, you should draft a preliminary outline
of the major issues you identified in your research.
For example, in my research for our client, Claudia Jackson, with respect to her warranty of habitability claim,
I mentioned earlier that I had found a state-specific secondary source that laid out a four-element test
for an implied warranty of habitability claim.
The Missouri Practice Series section stated that, in order to state a cause of action for breach
of an implied warranty of habitability claim, the tenant must prove, one, entry into a lease
for residential property, two, the subsequent development of a dangerous or unsanitary condition
on the premises materially affecting the life, health, and safety of the tenant, three, reasonable
notice of the defects to the landlord, and four, subsequent failure to restore the premises to habitability.
Take a minute to sketch out what you believe would be a solid preliminary outline for the warranty
of habitability claim based on the law we found.
Thank you.

Behind the claim, you will see that I included the citation from where I got the four-part test.
For now, I've left the wording for each element as it appeared in the secondary source.
I may adjust or paraphrase the language later.
Under the main claim, I've listed a rule that the tenant has the burden of proof on this claim as well.
I've included this point as its own rule.
I've included this point as its own rule because I anticipate it may become a part of my thesis or umbrella paragraph later on.
And again, I've included a note to the citation behind this rule.
I may also make a list of other cases under the different elements to the extent my research returned additional information about how each of these are interpreted.
By doing so, I am linking my outline to my research results as I proceed to actually pull the primary sources for my research.
As I proceed with my research, if I identify further issues or sub-issues that need to be addressed, I would modify my outline accordingly.
After you've made your preliminary outline, take a look at the sources and make note of the hierarchy of authorities.
If there were a relevant constitutional provision, you'd pull it first.
As you know, statutory sources would be next in the hierarchy, followed by regulations, and finally, you would pull the case law.
You should generally plan to start with the main controlling authority for your legal question and proceed down from there.
In my research, I didn't uncover a constitutional, statutory, or regulatory provision.
Thus, based on the information I have right now, it appears to be a common law issue.
Assuming I had exhausted my research into secondary sources for this topic area in this jurisdiction,
I would feel comfortable focusing my research on case law.
Of course, if I were to begin my research and determine that there was a controlling statute on this issue,
we'd have to make some adjustments to my outline and my plan.
But based on the information I currently have, starting with controlling case law appears appropriate for now.
Next week, we will do just that.
We will go and pull the relevant case law to start our primary law research.
