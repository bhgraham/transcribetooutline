If there were an initiation into the legal profession, it would be the rule against perpetuities.
I guarantee that if you mention this rule among a gathering of lawyers, you will hear
groans and you will probably hear some people exclaim, I never really understood that rule.
Well, it's my goal and expectation this semester that you will not only understand it, but
that you will develop a confidence in analyzing conveyances to determine whether or not the
future interests in those conveyances are valid under the rule.
So let's get started.
The purpose of the rule against perpetuities is to limit the extent of dead-hand control
that one can exercise over property.
As formulated under the common law, the rule provides no contingent future interest is valid
unless it is certain to vest or fail not later than 21 years after a life and being at the
creation of the interest.
What this rule enables the grantor to do is to make a gift to takers in the first generation
after known lives and to condition it upon the traditional age of majority, the age of
21.
Contingent future interest must be analyzed under the rule at the time the conveyance becomes
effective.
That is, if it is an inter vivos conveyance, the conveyance is analyzed for validity at
the time the conveyance is executed.
If it is a testamentary devise, it is analyzed at the moment of the decedent's death.
If an interest fails the rule scrutiny, it is void ab initio, in other words, void from
the moment that it was purportedly created.
A conveyance that contains a contingent future interest that is void under the rule must be
construed as if it did not contain the faulty interest.
Let's take a look at the constituent parts and break this down step by step.
Let's begin by looking at the type of future interests that are subject to the rule.
The rule applies only to contingent future interests in a transferee.
So future interests in a transferor are not subject to the rule.
If a conveyance contains a reversion, a possibility of reverter, or a right of entry, those future
interests do not need to be scrutinized under the rule.
What are contingent future interests in the transferee?
Please note that category is broader than merely contingent remainders.
Contingent future interests include not only contingent remainders, but also vested
remainders subject to open and executory interests.
Each of these types of future interests contains some sort of contingency to vesting.
If you recall, with a contingent remainder, it is contingent because either we don't know
who the taker is, we have an ascertainment issue, or there is a condition precedent, or
both.
With a vested remainder subject to open, the contingency is closure of that class gift.
And with executory interest, by definition, an executory interest is a divesting interest on
a condition precedent, on a condition that has to happen first.
If it is a springing executory interest, it will divest the transferor, and if it is a
shifting executory interest, it will divest a transferee.
These are the types of contingent future interests that must be analyzed under the rule against
perpetuities.
Thus, the first question you should ask yourself when examining a conveyance for validity under
the rule is whether you have a contingent future interest.
Identify all future interests in the conveyance, and then hone in on any that meet the definition
for a contingent future interest.
Next, be sure to remember that the rule is applied at the moment the conveyance becomes
effective.
If it is an inter vivos conveyance, that moment is when the conveyance is executed.
If it is a testamentary devise, the relevant facts are those that exist when the testator
dies.
Also keep in mind that if a contingent future interest violates the rule, that interest is
void ad initio, meaning from its purported creation, it is as if it never existed in the
language of conveyance.
You may encounter many tips for applying the rule against perpetuities.
What I recommend in this video is what works for me, and what seems to have helped a lot
of my students.
That said, if you find the techniques described in the textbook to be more helpful to you,
then by all means use them.
These are all roads to the same destination.
What I recommend is that you work in three steps.
First, you analyze the conveyance to identify all contingent future interests in a transferee.
Then, second, for each of those contingent future interests, identify what the vesting
event for that interest would be.
And third, find a validating life or lives, if there are any, for each of those vesting
events.
And that validating life must be one that has relevance for the vesting event.
The textbook refers to it as causally related.
But remember, the only real way to learn the rule against perpetuities is by practice and
looking at examples.
Before we do that, I have one other tip for you.
The rule against perpetuities describes the perpetuities period as lives in being and not
later than 21 years thereafter.
The 21 years part of the definition only comes into play when we have conditions that involve
reaching a certain age or the passage of a certain period of time.
For many conveyances, it will not be relevant.
So I recommend that you put the 21 years off to the side and only bring it to the table
if you need it for the particular vesting event at hand.
It is much simpler to look at just these three steps.
The contingent future interest, the vesting event for that interest, and the validating
life or lives, if any, exist for that vesting event.
Okay, let's look at some examples.
In our first example, O conveys to A for life, then to A's children for their lives, remainder
to B.
We're not told whether A has children at the time of this conveyance.
Our first task, then, is to identify whether there are any contingent future interests in
a transferee.
Analyzing this conveyance, we see that A has the present possessory interest, a life estate.
The remainder in life estate to A's children is a contingent future interest.
Because we know that A is alive, this interest in A's children is either a contingent remainder,
if A does not have children yet, or if at least one child is born and known, then
the remainder would be a vested remainder subject to open in life estate.
So, the answer is yes, we have a contingent future interest.
The remainder to B in fee simple is an indefeasibly vested remainder, and it does not need to be
analyzed under the rule.
The next step in our analysis is we need to determine what is the vesting event for the
contingent future interest, the remainder for life, in A's children.
When we look at the remainder for life in A's children and ask what is the contingency,
or another way of putting that is what is the vesting event, we realize that it is being
a child of A and closing the class.
That leads us then to our third question, which is do we have a validating life for
that vesting event?
The answer to this last question is yes, A is a validating life.
The class will close at the conclusion of A's life.
In other words, we will know at the conclusion of A's life whether A had children and the
identities of all of those children.
Given that all of the contingent future interests in this conveyance are valid under the rule,
what is the state of the title?
A has a life estate.
A's children have either a contingent remainder for life, if none are yet born, or a vested remainder
subject to open, for life, if at least one child is born.
B has an indefeasibly vested remainder, in fee simple.
Let's look at our next example.
O conveys to A for life, then to A's children for their lives, remainder to A's grandchildren.
We're told that A is alive and has one child B, and no grandchildren.
First, let's analyze to identify any contingent future interests in a transferee.
In analyzing this conveyance, we find that we have two contingent future interests.
One in B, who has a vested remainder subject to open, in life estate, and the other in A's
grandchildren, there are none identified at this time, so it would be a contingent remainder
in fee simple.
Our second step is to identify what the vesting event is for each of these contingent future
interests.
The vesting event for B's vested remainder subject to open in life estate is simply closure
of the class of A's children.
The vesting event for the contingent remainder in A's grandchildren is closure of the class
of A's grandchildren.
Next, we need to analyze for the validating life or lives for each of these vesting events.
In our search for validating lives for these vesting events, we find that yes, we do have
a validating life for B's interest.
A can serve as a validating life because at the end of A's life, the class of A's children
will close, thus vesting B's interest.
However, the contingent remainder in A's grandchildren is problematic.
We do not have the requisite validating lives.
Why?
Because we would need to have a closed class of A's children to serve as a validating life
for ascertainment of the identity of A's grandchildren.
Because the class of A's children is open at the time of this conveyance, we do not have
the requisite validating lives, and therefore, the contingent remainder in A's grandchildren
is void.
And as you recall, if an interest is void under Rule Against Perpetuities analysis, it is
considered void ab initio from the beginning, as if the conveyance had been drafted without
that interest.
Any interest that is void under Rule Against Perpetuities analysis must be stricken from
the conveyance.
In our example, then, the conveyance now reads, to A for life, then to A's children for their
lives.
The language remainder to A's grandchildren has been stricken.
So what, then, is the state of the title as a result of this conveyance?
A has a life estate, B has a vested remainder subject to open in life estate, and O has a
reversion.
Let's reconsider this example, changing one fact.
If instead of an intervibos conveyance, what if the testator, T, devises to A for life,
then to A's children for their lives, remainder to A's grandchildren, and we're told that A
predeceased T, would this change the result?
The answer, of course, is yes, because the class of A's children is already closed when the
conveyance became effective, which, of course, was on T's death.
Therefore, the contingent future interest in the grandchildren will vest or fail no later
than the death of A's last child to die.
So, in other words, the class of A's children, because it is a closed class under this example,
can serve as the validating life for the remainder in A's grandchildren.
Let's consider one final example.
O conveys to A for life, then to A's children who reach age 21.
We're told that at the time of the conveyance, A is alive and has one child, B, age 6.
Following our three-step approach, the first part of our analysis is to identify any
contingent future interest in a transferee.
That analysis reveals that, yes, B has a contingent future interest.
B has a contingent remainder.
B is a child of A, and there is a condition precedent.
B must not only be a child of A, but B must reach the age of 21.
Keep in mind that this vesting event, being a child of A and reaching age 21, applies not
only to B, but to any other children that might be born of A. Generally, when we identify
an interest in a conveyance, once we have a known taker, that identification is with reference
to that taker.
But if A has more children, obviously those children will likewise have a contingent remainder.
Now we need to analyze whether we have a validating life for this vesting event.
Yes, we have a validating life for this vesting event.
That life is A, because at A's death, all of A's children will be known, and no later
than 21 years thereafter, we will also know who among them has reached the age of 21.
Note, this conveyance demonstrates an example of when we do, in fact, need that 21-year period
in order to validate the contingent future interest.
This interest in A's children who reach age 21 is valid because we will know, at the conclusion
of A's life, the validating life, who all of the potential takers are, and we will
know no later than 21 years after A's death who among those children have reached the
age of 21.
So what is the state of the title?
A has a life estate, B has a contingent remainder, and O has a reversion.
Why does the transferor have a reversion?
Because it is possible that B's contingent remainder will not vest if B fails to reach
the age of 21, and it's also possible that A may not have any children who satisfy that
condition precedent.
And now the time has come for the most important step in your mastery of the rule against perpetuities,
and that is practice, practice, practice.
Good luck.
Good luck.
