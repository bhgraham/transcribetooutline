Now that you are familiar with present possessory estates and land, it's time to learn future
interests.
A future interest is a presently existing legal interest that will or may become possessory
in the future.
At first encounter, most students find future interests daunting.
My goal in this video is to introduce you to a methodology that will help you identify
and analyze future interests correctly each and every time out.
Think of it like a board game.
You have to know the rules before you can play.
That's what this video is about, so let's have some fun with future interests.
Perhaps without realizing it, you have already learned the class of future interests that
can be held by a transferor.
There are three types, the reversion, the possibility of reverter, and a right of entry or power of
termination.
A transferor retains a reversion any time the transferor carves out a lesser estate than
what the transferor has.
So in the instance of a transferor who has a fee simple absolute, when a life estate is
carved out, the transferor retains a reversion in fee simple absolute.
So in our example, O conveys to A for life.
At the end of A's life, which is the end of the life estate, O's reversion becomes possessory
once again, and O is restored to a fee simple absolute.
The possibility of reverter accompanies the creation of a fee simple determinable.
Our example, O conveys to A so long as A uses the land for farming.
Now if you recall, a defeasible fee is of potentially infinite duration.
So long as A uses the land for farming, A's fee simple determinable will not be defeased.
But if A ceases to use the land for farming, then O's future interest, the possibility of
reverter, automatically becomes possessory.
The right of entry, power of termination, as you recall, does not operate in an automatic fashion.
This future interest in a transferor accompanies the creation of a fee simple subject to condition
subsequent.
In this example, O conveys to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, that's
the condition subsequent, O has the right to reenter.
If A no longer uses the land for farming, O has to exercise that right to reenter.
Now let's turn to future interests in the transferee.
There are three types.
