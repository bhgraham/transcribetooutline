and to distinguishing between the present and the future interests that the parties have in those estates.
Let's take a look.
There were four categories of estates in feudal England, the fee simple, the fee tail, life estate, and leasehold estates.
And despite the intervening centuries between feudal England and our modern day,
we have not added any new estates to this system of possessory interests.
And in fact, we no longer recognize the fee tail estate in the United States, so we will not study that.
That was an estate that was created to keep land within the bloodline of a family in feudal times.
So we will concentrate on the fee simple, on the life estate, and leasehold tenancies we will put aside to week six,
where we will give them concentrated study at all.
at that time.
Estates are present possessory interests that are measured in terms of duration.
The fee simple has two categories, fee simple absolute and fee simple defeasible,
which we'll explore in greater depth in a moment.
The life estate is one of the few estates that is pretty much what it sounds to be,
and that is an estate measured by a person's life.
This graphic sets out the basic distinction between a fee simple absolute and a fee simple defeasible.

absolute has been created. Today, it is no longer necessary to include the terminology and his
heirs or and her heirs in a conveyance when the objective is to create a fee simple absolute.
And where those words may appear, it is important that you remember that these are just words of
limitation and not words of purchase. Also, in our system of estates, it is important to note that a
bit more vandaag web opera is closed but it has been TIME. And we're каче preaching.
But I just noted that, with such a question here, it
is important that...
We, I think, are the clams kind of mentality going after the product of
start to offer that, of course, a vehicle aience left right?
This is what what we expect to do versus what the provenance of the order is
divisible and descendable. If you will recall when I set forth the context for what we were
going to study this semester, I talked about the typical ways that property interests are created
and the two categories, creation inter vivos and creation at death. So when we say an interest
is alienable, we're talking about an inter vivos transfer of some type. To say that it's divisible
means that it passes through a will, and to say that it's descendable means that it is passed
through intestate succession, which is controlled by statute, when a person has neither planned with
a will or with non-testamentary devices, such as beneficiary designations.
Next, we turn to the fee simple defeasible. There are three types of defeasible fees.
The language that's used to construct the conveyance is determinative of the type of
defeasible fee. There are component parts to these conveyances that will help you identify
correctly every time out what type of defeasible fee has been created and what the consequences
will be for those who hold the present or future interest in the conveyance. Unlike so many areas
of the law, this area has a right and a wrong answer. So for those who resonate to that type
of analysis, you'll love this area of the law because once you learn the component parts,
you will be able to correctly analyze a problem set without fail each time out. Okay, let's start out
with looking at the basic construction for each type of defeasible fee. The first one on this graphic
is the fee simple determinable. You will recognize this because in each fee simple determinable,
there is incorporated into the conveyance durational language. In my example, it's to a so long as,
but the durational language might be something like to a until, to a during such time as. All of those
phrases are durational and create the limitation that is wrapped right up in the creation of the
defeasible fee. The other two types of defeasible fees contain a condition subsequent. So the construction
would be 2A, but if, and now insert the condition subsequent, if this condition happens, then there is a
slip and the

That last for the duration of someone's life.
Once that person, the life tenant, passes away, the property goes to another person called
a remainder or back to the original owner or their heirs.
A lease hold is a temporary right to occupy the property, typically for a specified number
of years.
It's basically what a tenant has under a lease agreement and it eventually expires or can
be renewed.
So these terms describe different levels of control and duration of property ownership
or use.
Let me know if you need more details on any of these.
When they say fee, it basically refers
to an inheritable estate in land.
The term comes from old English property law
and is shorthand for feud or feudal,
relating to the feudal system of landholding.
In modern usage, fee indicates that the estate
is capable of being inherited.
For example, fee simple means you have the simplest
and most extensive ownership interest in the property
that can be passed on to your heirs.
So fee is just a, you're welcome.
Right, fee refers to an inheritable interest in land.
It means that the ownership of the estate
can be passed down to heirs or assigned to others,
making it a permanent or enduring type of ownership.
So when you hear fee simple or fee tail,
it's describing the kind of inheritable interest
the owner has in the property.
Sure, when we talk about a fee interest,
we're describing the type of inheritable ownership
that an owner has in a property.
Basically, it means the owner's interest in the property
can be passed down to heirs or others,
ensuring the ownership continues
beyond the current owner's lifetime.
This is in contrast to something like a life estate,
which ends when the life tenant passes away.
So fee essentially signals that the interest is inheritable
and not just for a limited time.
Yeah, it comes from the old feudal system.
Back in medieval England,
land ownership was structured around the feudal system,
where lords granted land or fiefs
to vassals in exchange for services.
Over time, these feudal interests evolved
into the more modern concept of fee interests,
which are inheritable and can be freely transferred.
So the term fee is a holdover from that historical context,
indicating a type of inheritable ownership in land.
Exactly, you got it.
Fee simple is full ownership
with the right to pass it on however you want.
Fee tail restricts inheritance to your family line.
Life estate lasts for the duration of your life
and leasehold is controlled for the length of the lease.
Nailed it.
That's the core of it.
Another detail you might come across
is that each of these interests
can have conditions or limitations.
For example, a fee simple determinable
or fee simple subject to conditions subsequent
might mean that the ownership could revert to someone else
if a certain condition is met or violated.
But the main categories you covered are the big ones.
If you understand these,
you've got a solid grasp on the basics.
Sure, let's bike it down further.
A fee simple absolute is the most complete form of ownership.
You have unlimited rights to the property and it can be sold, alienable,
given away in a will, divisable, or passed to your heirs if you die without a will.
There's no condition or limitation on it, so it lasts forever and can freely be transferred
or inherited without any strings attached.
A fee simple defeasible is a type of fee simple that comes with conditions.
If a certain condition is violated or a specific event occurs, the property could revert to the original owner or pass to someone else.
For example, a fee simple determinable automatically ends if the condition is breached.
And a fee simple subject to conditions subsequent requires the original owner to take action to reclaim the property if the condition is breached.
So the key difference is that a fee simple absolute has no conditions, while a fee simple defeasible has some kind of limitation or condition that could cause the ownership to end or change if the condition is not met.
Exactly, you got it.
Fee simple absolute has no conditions and fee simple defeasible has conditions that can affect ownership.
A fee simple subject to conditions subsequent is a type of fee simple defeasible.
It means the property is granted with a condition attached.
If that condition is violated, the original owner or their heirs has the right to take back the property, but they must take some action to enforce this right.
In other words, the ownership doesn't automatically end when the condition is breached.
Instead, the original owner has the option to reclaim it, usually through legal proceedings.
It's a bit more flexible for the current holder than a fee simple determinable because the ownership only changes if the original owner decides to act on the breach.
A fee simple determinable is another type of fee simple defeasible.
A fee simple defeasible with this type, the estate automatically ends and reverts to the original owner if a specific condition is violated.
The key difference is that the reversion happens automatically without the original owner needing to take any action.
For example, if you grant someone a piece of land so long as it is used for a school, the moment it stops being used for a school, the property automatically reverts back to you or your heirs.
It creates a possibility of automatic forfeiture if the condition is not met.
As long as the land is used for farming.
Now, we could have phrased it to a until such time as a land is no longer used for farming or we could have said to a during the time that the land is used for farming.
So it could be different types of durational language, but what's essential is that it is creating a durational limit on that fee that if the limitation is violated, the fee is what we call defeased.
The fee ends, so given that this is the present possessory interest, this fee simple determinable, if the land is no longer used for farming, who then has the present possessory interest?
The answer to this question is that O, the transferor, would once again have a fee simple absolute.
Now let's look more closely at the transferor side of this concession.
Exactly. When the condition is violated in a fee simple determinable, the property automatically reverts to the original owner or their heirs.
The original owner or whoever holds the future interest now has the present possessory interest again.
This makes it a powerful tool for ensuring that the land is used as intended, but it also means the current holder must adhere strictly to the condition to maintain ownership.
That interest is called a possibility of reverter. A possibility of reverter is among a class of interest known as future interest.
Why do we label this a future interest?
First, it should be noted that a possibility of reverter is a presently existing legal interest.
But what is future in its character is that the possibility of possession is in the future.
So let's look at our conveyance again and suppose that A continues to use the land for farming throughout A's lifetime.
So in other words, the limitation is never violated. O's possibility of reverter then never became possessory.
So that's why it's a possibility of reverter.
The possibility exists that the limitation, the land being used for farming, might be violated, in which case O would then once again have the present possessory interest.
Note that if the limitation in a fee simple determinable is violated, the possibility of reverter becomes possessory automatically.
So let's recap what we've learned about the fee simple determinable.
In the conveyance O conveys greenacre to A, so long as the land is used for farming, if you are asked to identify the state of the title to greenacre, what is the appropriate response?
A has a fee simple determinable, and this is the present interest because that is the present possessory interest in the estate.
O has a possibility of reverter, which is known as the future interest.
If you recall, the other two types of the feasible fees each contain a condition subsequent.
First, let's look at the fee simple subject to condition subsequent.
Our example is that O conveys greenacre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, O has the right to reenter.
The phrase, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, is known as a condition subsequent.
If you look at the construction, think of it in these terms.
The conveyance grants something to A, but the phrase, the condition subsequent, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, is the mechanism that could take it away.
That is the condition subsequent.
A is said to have a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and A's interest, this defeasible fee, is the present possessory interest.
What is unique to a fee simple subject to condition subsequent is that the transfer or, O in our example, holds the future interest.
O has the right to reenter.
A distinction between a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and a fee simple determinable, which we just looked at, is that with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, O's right to reenter does not result in automatic divestment of A's defeasible fee, but it gives O the option to reenter.
In other words, O must exercise the right to reenter.
What happens if A no longer uses the land for farming and O does not exercise the right to reenter?
Well, if the period of time for asserting property interest passes, in other words, the statute of limitations passes, A would then have a fee simple absolute unencumbered by the condition subsequent.
So once the condition subsequent happens, it starts the statute running that sets the time period within which O has to assert O's right to reenter.
So what is the label that we give to O's interest at the time that O creates the fee simple subject to condition subsequent in A?
We call O's interest a right of entry. It is sometimes also phrased as a power of termination.
The right of entry is called a future interest because there is the possibility of a future right of possession.
Although the possessory interest is future, a right of entry or power of termination, if phrased that way, is a presently existing legal interest, just not a possessory one.
Let's then review the fee simple subject to condition subsequent. In our example, O conveys green acre to A, but if A no longer uses a land for farming, O has the right to reenter, what is the state of the title?
The correct answer is that A has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which is the present interest, and O has a right of entry, the future interest.
The third type of defeasible fee is the fee simple subject to executory limitation. Like the fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the fee simple subject to executory limitation always contains a condition subsequent.
In fact, in our example, O conveys green acre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, then to C, the condition subsequent is exactly the same condition subsequent as we used in our fee simple subject to condition subsequent illustration, that being, but if A no longer uses the land for farming.
What is different between the fee simple subject to executory limitation and the fee simple subject to condition subsequent is that in the fee simple subject to executory limitation, the future interest is held by another transferee rather than the transferor.
In this example, then to C creates an executory interest in C, and if the condition subsequent occurs, A no longer using the land for farming, the executory interest in C will automatically divest A's fee.
If you recall, in our example of the fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the right of entry in O was not automatic upon the occurrence of the condition subsequent. O had to exercise that right.
In contrast, the executory interest in C, in this example, does operate in an automatic fashion to divest A's fee.
A, in this example, is said to have a fee simple subject to executory limitation, and this is the present possessory interest until or unless the condition subsequent happens.
You should also note that in some literature, the feasible fee is known as a fee simple subject to executory interest.
The terminology executory limitation and executory interest are interchangeable.
With a fee simple subject to executory limitation, if the condition subsequent happens, who then has the present possessory interest?
The answer, of course, is C, who held the executory interest, now has the present possessory interest, which we call a fee simple absolute.
So let's review the fee simple subject to executory limitation.
If the conveyance is O conveys Green Acre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, then to C, what is the state of the title to Green Acre?
The answer is that A has a fee simple subject to executory limitation, which is the present possessory interest, and C has an executory interest, which is a future interest.
This recap comparison of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent with a fee simple subject to executory limitation should help you keep these two types of defeasible fees distinguished.
While they both contain a condition subsequent, the most obvious difference is that with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the future interest is in the transferor, and the language indicates that there is a fee simple subject to condition subsequent.
Thank you.
Thank you.
That interest has either a right to reenter or a power to terminate.
With the fee simple subject to executory limitation, the future interest is in a transferee, and that interest is an executory interest.
A distinction in terms of the way that defeasement operates in each of these defeasible fees is that with the fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the fee is not automatically divested when the condition subsequent occurs.
The transferor has to elect to use the right to reenter or the power to terminate.
With a fee simple subject to executory limitation, the fee is automatically divested by the executory interest.
Now let's look at the easiest estate to recognize, the life estate.
A life estate is either measured by the transferee's life or measured by the life of another.
Our example O conveys to A for life illustrates a life estate measured by the transferee's life.
O conveys to A for the life of B is an example of a life estate measured by the life of another in this example B.
A life estate that is measured by the life of another is known as a life estate per autre vie.
Whether the life estate is measured by the transferee's life or by the life of another, the life estate is the present possessory interest.

Who has the future interest?
The answer is that O, the transferor, has the future interest known as a reversion.
Note, at the conclusion of the life estate, O's future interest becomes possessory.
When that happens, we classify O's interest as, once again, a fee symbol absolute.
Let's recap.
If O conveys Greenacre to A for life, what is the state of the title to Greenacre?
A has a life estate, the present possessory interest.
We classify O's interest as, once again, a fee symbol absolute.
Let's recap.
If O conveys Greenacre to A for life, what is the state of the title to Greenacre?
A has a life estate, the present possessory interest.
O has a reversion, the future interest.
