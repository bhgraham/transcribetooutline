We are now entering the study of estates and land.
Estates are the basic building blocks of both real estate practice and estate planning.
Our system of estates and land is built on the English common law system that developed
in feudal times.
And as such, you are going to find the terms and the nomenclature very unfamiliar.
But just like names arbitrarily given to individuals, the only way to really master this terminology
is to memorize it and to practice making the associations between those terms and the interests
they represent.
In this video, I offer you a methodical approach to learning estates and land and to distinguishing
between the present and the future interests that the parties have in those estates.
Let's take a look.
There were four categories of estates in feudal England.
The fee simple, the fee tail, life estate and leasehold estates.
And despite the intervening centuries between feudal England and our modern day, we have
not added any new estates to this system of possessory interests.
And in fact, we no longer recognize the fee tail estate in the United States.
So we will not study that.
That was an estate that was created to keep land within the bloodline of a family in feudal
times.
So we will concentrate on the fee simple, on the life estate and leasehold tenancies.
We will put aside to week six, where we will give them concentrated study at that time.
Estates are present possessory.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
