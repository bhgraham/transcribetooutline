In the first video lecture for this week, I introduced you to the concept of future
interests. As you recall, a future interest is a presently existing legal interest, but
what is future about that interest is the possibility of possession. In the prior video,
we explored, in general, the entire landscape of future interests, including interests that
can be held by a transferor and those that can be held by a transferee. Future interests
in a transferee include executory interests as well as remainders, and remainders are further
classified as either contingent or vested. Now, within those classifications of remainders,
there are further details that are important to your ability to recognize and correctly label
remainder interests, and that's what we will focus on primarily in this video presentation.
As you may recall, in order to have a remainder, there must be something for that remainder to
remain after, and that something is a present possessory interest in a transferee that qualifies
as a prior supporting estate. You may recall from the introductory video that a prior supporting
estate is one that is of a lesser duration than a fee simple absolute or a fee simple defeasible.
So, in other words, it is generally a life estate, a life estate per attra vie, or a leasehold estate
known as a term of years. Now, it need not be certain that the remainder will become possessory
upon the natural expiration of that prior supporting estate. It need only be possible. And what do we
mean by the natural expiration of that prior supporting estate? Well, if it is a life estate,
it is simply the end of the measuring life for that life estate. Or if it is a term of years,
it is the conclusion of that time period set out for the term of years leasehold estate. In other
words, there doesn't have to be the happening of a vesting condition. It is just the natural
expiration of that prior supporting estate. To put into perspective the remainder interest,
it's helpful to contrast it with executory interest. If you recall, an executory interest
vests in possession only by divesting another interest. In other words, there is a condition that
serves as that vesting event. And again, the remainder simply vests in possession upon the natural
conclusion or expiration of that prior supporting estate. Let's review the graphic that summarizes
executory interests. If you recall, executory interests are known as divesting interests on a
condition precedent. This is because the only way that an executory interest can become possessory
is by the happening of a condition that will divest the current holder of the possessory interest and
vest into the holder of the executory interest possession. Executory interests are labeled with reference to
whether the interest will divest a transferor or will divest another transferee. The executory interest
that divests a transferor is known as a springing executory interest. I find it helpful to think
about it as springing back to the transferor and divesting that transferor if the vesting event
occurs. With the shifting executory interest, the holder of the present possessory interest
is another transferee. So if we think about the two sides of the conveyance, one being the transferor and
the other one being the transferee side, an executory interest is on the same side as the holder of
the possessory interest. If we look at our example of a shifting executory interest, it helps to
illustrate this point. O conveys to A, but if C graduates law school, then to C. A, a transferee,
currently holds a fee simple subject to executory limitation. C has the shifting executory interest
and the vesting event, but if C graduates law school, is the condition subsequent as to A's interest
that actually acts like a condition precedent to the vesting of C's interest. If C graduates law school,
C's executory interest shifts over and divests A. In contrast, our first example, O conveys to C,
if C graduates law school, the present possessory interest in this example is held by O, the transferor.
It is a fee simple subject to executory limitation, but one held by a transferor. So the condition to
vesting if C graduates law school is more apparent in its nature of a condition precedent because it is
the thing that has to happen if C's executory interest is going to spring back and divest the transferor.
Now let's consider these examples of conveyances that contain remainder interest. Hopefully our
brief review of executory interest will help you distinguish a remainder interest from an
executory interest. Now in each of these conveyances, I have highlighted in yellow the
portion that constitutes a remainder. We will come back to each of these separately to determine exactly
what type of remainder is created. Before we do that though, I would like to look at the prior
supporting estate in each of these conveyances. If you recall, in order to have a remainder in a
conveyance, there must be something for that remainder to remain after, and that something
is the prior supporting estate. A prior supporting estate is an estate of a lesser duration than either
a fee simple absolute or a fee simple defeasible, and it must be at least possible for the remainder
to vest in possession at the natural expiration or conclusion of that prior supporting estate.
So in our first example to A for life, we have a life estate, and while it is not certain that C
will have graduated law school by the end of A's life, it is at least possible. In the second example
to A for the life of B, this is a life estate per otra B. So at the end of B's life, then C's interest
is to vest in possession. What if C happens to die before B? It doesn't matter because C's
remainder interest can pass to C's estate. In the last example to A for five years, we have what's
called a term of years or a leasehold estate. It's to A for five years, then to B's children. What if in
five years, B doesn't have any children yet? Again, it doesn't matter. What's important is that it's at
least possible, and so we have a remainder interest that is remaining after this prior supporting estate.
So let's take a look more closely at each of these conveyances to determine the proper label for
the remainder interest contained in each. In our first example, O conveys to A for life, then to C,
if C graduates law school. What C has is a contingent remainder. Why is it contingent? Because there is
contained within that remainder a condition precedent. That condition is if C graduates law school.
In our second example, O conveys to A for the life of B, then to C, C has an indefeasibly vested
remainder. We know who the taker is, and there is no condition precedent to the vesting, nor is there a
condition subsequent that could take it away. So it is an indefeasibly vested remainder. In our third
example, O conveys to A for five years, then to B's children, we need more information before we can
put a label on this remainder interest. So what do we need to know? Well, the relevant questions are,
is B alive, and does B have any children? If B is alive, but B has no children, then the remainder is
a contingent remainder. Why? Because the takers, the potential takers, are unascertained.
If B is alive and has at least one child, then the remainder is labeled as a vested remainder
subject to open. And what subject to open means is that that child's interest could be partially
divested by the birth of more children. The remainder remains subject to open until the class
of B's children is closed. When does that happen? Closure of that class will happen on B's death.
And what if B is dead at the time of this conveyance? If B is dead and has children,
then the remainder is an indefeasibly vested remainder. The takers are known and the class
is closed. So B's children will share proportionately in this vested remainder.
As you will recall, there are two basic categories of remainders, contingent and vested. Let's review
the features of each. Contingent remainders occur when we have an ascertainment issue in the conveyance.
If you take a look at the example on the graphic, 2A for life, remainder 2A's children,
and we're told that A has no children at the time of the conveyance, so the potential takers are
unascertained, or there is a condition precedent. Our example with a condition precedent is to A
for life, remainder 2B if B survives A, or the conveyance has both, both an ascertainment issue
and a condition precedent. So our example for this is to A for life, remainder 2A's children who survive
A and we're told that A has no children at the time of the conveyance. So while a remainder may be
considered contingent for different reasons, no matter what the reason, ascertainment, condition
precedent, or both, we simply call that remainder a contingent remainder. If we know at least one
taker and there is no condition precedent to vesting, the remainder is some type of vested
remainder. That said, there are three types of vested remainders. The most easily recognizable
vested remainder is the indefeasibly vested remainder. In our example, the conveyance is to
A for life, remainder 2B. We have a known taker, there is no condition precedent, and there is no
condition subsequent. The second type of vested remainder is vested subject to open. Our example,
to A for life, remainder 2B's children. And in this example, we're told that B is alive and has
one child D. This is a class gift. So with a vested remainder subject to open, we know at least one
taker, but we have an open class of takers. The third type of vested remainder, vested subject to
complete divestment, occurs when the remainderman has the interest, the future interest, but could lose
it upon the happening of a condition subsequent. So in our example, to A for life, remainder to C,
but if C fails to survive A, then to B, C has a vested interest. However, C could lose it upon the
happening of the condition subsequent. And that condition in the conveyance is, but if C fails
to survive A. Who would take if that condition happens? Well, B would take. B has the shifting
executory interest. Now, while there are only three types of vested remainders, indefeasibly vested,
vested subject to open, and vested subject to complete divestment, and this is sometimes phrased
simply as subject to divestment, while there are only those three types, it is possible for a taker to
have a vested remainder that is both subject to open and subject to complete divestment. Consider the
example. O conveys to A for life, then to B's children, but if B has no children that survive
A, then to C. In this example, we're told that B is alive and has one child, D. So D has a vested
remainder subject to open. His interest is a part of a class gift to B's children, and so if additional
children are born to that class before it closes, D's interest will be diluted. But D's interest is
also subject to complete divestment. What would the divesting event be that could completely take away
D's interest? It would be that on the death of A, that none of B's children survive A. In the event of
that occurrence, then D's interest would be completely divested. So again, for now, just
keep in mind that while there are three types of vested remainders, it is possible for a remainder
to be both subject to open and subject to complete divestment. This occurs when you have both a gift
to an open class or conveyance to an open class, and you have a condition subsequent that could
completely divest that interest. So let's recap. With a contingent remainder, either no taker is
ascertained, there is a condition precedent, or both. Regardless, all contingent remainders are simply
called contingent. With a vested remainder, we know at least one taker, and there is no
condition precedent. The three types of vested remainders are indefeasibly vested, vested subject
to open, and vested subject to divestment. Those learning future interests, and particularly
remainders, often have difficulty distinguishing between conditions precedent and conditions
subsequent. The key question to this determination is, must the condition happen before or after to
vest possession. If the condition must happen before, then it is a condition precedent. And if
it happens after, in other words, it operates to take possession away from one transferee and vest
it in another, then it is a condition subsequent. Let's look at condition precedent examples. O conveys to
A for life, then to C, if C graduates law school. If C graduates law school is a condition precedent
to C's interest, a contingent remainder vesting. In the second example, O conveys to A for life, then to C,
if C graduates law school, and if C does not graduate law school, to D. This example looks
similar to the first because we have the condition precedent, if C graduates law school, necessary to
vest possession in C, but then we have the reverse of that, and if C does not graduate law school,
operating as a condition to vest possession in D. What these remainders in this example are called
is alternate contingent remainders. They are alternate because if the condition happens, C graduating law
school, possession goes to C. And if the condition does not happen, C does not graduate law school,
it goes to D. So these are alternate contingent remaindermen, and the vesting of possession depends on
the happening or the failure to happen of the same condition. In our last example, O conveys to C
if C graduates law school. This is a condition precedent, but what we have in this example is not a
contingent remainder. Why is this not a contingent remainder? Because if you recall, a remainder must
remain after something on the transferee side of the conveyance. In this example, the present possessory
interest is held by O. O holds a fee simple subject to executory limitation, and that means of course
that what C has is a springing executory interest. So to review, in our first conveyance to A for life
then to C if C graduates law school, C has a contingent remainder. In the second conveyance,
O conveys to A for life then to C if C graduates law school, and if C does not graduate law school,
to D, C and D have alternate contingent remainders. And in the last example, O conveys to C if C graduates
law school, C does not have a remainder, C has a springing executory interest. Because if the
condition precedent happens, C graduating law school, C's interest will divest O, the transfer or,
of O's fee simple subject to executory limitation. Now let's look at condition subsequent examples.
Our first example, O conveys to A, but if C graduates law school, then to C. But if C graduates law school
is the condition subsequent in that conveyance. In the second example, O conveys to A for life,
then to C. But if C fails to graduate law school, then to D. We have the same condition subsequent,
but if C fails to graduate law school. But what the interests are labeled in these conveyances
are very different. Let's take a closer look. In our first example, the present possessory interest
is held by A, and that interest is called a fee simple subject to executory limitation.
C has a shifting executory interest. Upon the occurrence of the condition subsequent,
C graduating law school, A's interest is divested, and C's shifting executory interest shifts over
into possession. In our last example, the present possessory interest is the life estate in A.
It is followed by a remainder interest in C. This is a vested remainder because we know who the taker
is, and there is no condition preceded. However, it is followed by a condition subsequent. That
condition is but if C fails to graduate law school. If that condition subsequent happens,
it will operate to divest C of C's vested interest. So what C has is a vested remainder subject to divestment,
sometimes referred to as subject to complete divestment, and the divesting interest, the
shifting executory interest, is held by D. Following this video, I have designed two problem
sets to test your knowledge of future interests in the transferee. I have divided the problem sets
into executory interests treated in one and remainder interests in the other to help reinforce what you
have learned about the distinguishing characteristics that separate executory interests from contingent
remainders and from vested remainders. Good luck with these.
Thank you.
If there were an initiation into the legal profession, it would be the rule against
perpetuities. I guarantee that if you mention this rule among a gathering of lawyers, you
will hear groans and you will probably hear some people exclaim, I never really understood
that rule. Well, it's my goal and expectation this semester that you will not only understand
it, but that you will develop a confidence in analyzing conveyances to determine whether
or not the future interests in those conveyances are valid under the rule. So let's get started.
The purpose of the rule against perpetuities is to limit the extent of deadhand control that one can
exercise over property. As formulated under the common law, the rule provides no contingent future
interest is valid unless it is certain to vest or fail not later than 21 years after a life and being
at the creation of the interest. What this rule enables the grantor to do is to make a gift to
takers in the first generation after known lives and to condition it upon the traditional age of
majority, the age of 21. Contingent future interests must be analyzed under the rule at the time the
conveyance becomes effective. That is, if it is an inter vivos conveyance, the conveyance is analyzed
for validity at the time the conveyance is executed. If it is a testamentary devise, it is analyzed at the
moment of the decedent's death. If an interest fails the rule scrutiny, it is void ab initio, in other
words, void from the moment that it was purportedly created. A conveyance that contains a contingent future
interest that is void under the rule must be construed as if it did not contain the faulty interest.
Let's take a look at the constituent parts and break this down step by step.
Let's begin by looking at the type of future interests that are subject to the rule.
The rule applies only to contingent future interests in a transferee. So future interests
in a transferor are not subject to the rule. If a conveyance contains a reversion, a possibility of
reverter, or a right of entry, those future interests do not need to be scrutinized under the rule.
What are contingent future interests in the transferee? Please note that category is broader
than merely contingent remainders. Contingent future interests include not only contingent remainders,
but also vested remainders subject to open and executory interests. Each of these types of future
interests contains some sort of contingency to vesting. If you recall, with a contingent
remainder, it is contingent because either we don't know who the taker is, we have an
ascertainment issue, or there is a condition precedent, or both. With a vested remainder
subject to open, the contingency is closure of that class gift. And with executory interest,
by definition, an executory interest is a divesting interest on a condition precedent,
on a condition that has to happen first. If it is a springing executory interest, it will divest
the transferor, and if it is a shifting executory interest, it will divest a transferee.
These are the types of contingent future interests that must be analyzed under the rule against
perpetuities. Thus, the first question you should ask yourself when examining a conveyance
for validity under the rule is whether you have a contingent future interest. Identify
all future interests in the conveyance, and then hone in on any that meet the definition
for a contingent future interest. Next, be sure to remember that the rule is applied at
the moment the conveyance becomes effective. If it is an inter-bibos conveyance, that moment is
when the conveyance is executed. If it is a testamentary devise, the relevant facts are
those that exist when the testator dies. Also keep in mind that if a contingent future interest
violates the rule, that interest is void ad initio, meaning from its purported creation,
it is as if it never existed in the language of conveyance.
You may encounter many tips for applying the rule against perpetuities. What I recommend in this video
is what works for me, and what seems to have helped a lot of my students. That said, if you find the
techniques described in the textbook to be more helpful to you, then by all means use them. These
are all roads to the same destination. What I recommend is that you work in three steps. First,
you analyze the conveyance to identify all contingent future interests in a transferee. Then, second,
for each of those contingent future interests, identify what the vesting event for that interest would be.
And third, find a validating life or lives, if there are any, for each of those vesting events.
And that validating life must be one that has relevance for the vesting event. The textbook
refers to it as causally related. But remember, the only real way to learn the rule against
perpetuities is by practice and looking at examples. Before we do that, I have one other tip for you.
The rule against perpetuities describes the perpetuities period as lives in being,
and not later than 21 years thereafter. The 21 years part of the definition only comes into play
when we have conditions that involve reaching a certain age or the passage of a certain period of time.
For many conveyances, it will not be relevant. So I recommend that you put the 21 years off to the
side and only bring it to the table if you need it for the particular vesting event at hand. It is
much simpler to look at just these three steps. The contingent future interest, the vesting event
for that interest, and the validating life or lives, if any, exist for that vesting event. Okay,
let's look at some examples. In our first example, O conveys to A for life, then to A's children for
their lives, remainder to B. We're not told whether A has children at the time of this conveyance.
Our first task then is to identify whether there are any contingent future interests
in a transferee. Analyzing this conveyance, we see that A has the present possessory interest,
a life estate. The remainder in life estate to A's children is a contingent future interest.
Because we know that A is alive, this interest in A's children is either a contingent remainder,
if A does not have children yet, or if at least one child is born and known, then the remainder would
be a vested remainder subject to open in life estate. So the answer is yes, we have a contingent future
interest. The remainder to B in fee simple is an indefeasibly vested remainder, and it does not
need to be analyzed under the rule. The next step in our analysis is we need to determine what is
the vesting event for the contingent future interest, the remainder for life in A's children.
When we look at the remainder for life in A's children and ask what is the contingency,
or another way of putting that is what is the vesting event, we realize that it is being a child of A
and closing the class. That leads us then to our third question, which is do we have a validating
life for that vesting event? The answer to this last question is yes, A is a validating life. The
class will close at the conclusion of A's life. In other words, we will know at the conclusion of A's
life whether A had children and the identities of all of those children. Given that all of the
contingent future interests in this conveyance are valid under the rule, what is the state of the
title? A has a life estate. A's children have either a contingent remainder for life, if none are yet born,
or a vested remainder subject to open for life, if at least one child is born. B has an indefeasibly
vested remainder in fee simple. Let's look at our next example. O conveys to A for life, then to A's
children for their lives, remainder to A's grandchildren. We're told that A is alive and
has one child B and no grandchildren. First, let's analyze to identify any contingent future interests
in a transferee. In analyzing this conveyance, we find that we have two contingent future interests.
One in B, who has a vested remainder subject to open in life estate, and the other in A's grandchildren,
there are none identified at this time, so it would be a contingent remainder in fee simple.
Our second step is to identify what the vesting event is for each of these contingent future
interests. The vesting event for B's vested remainder subject to open in life estate is simply
closure of the class of A's children. The vesting event for the contingent remainder in A's grandchildren
is closure of the class of A's grandchildren. Next, we need to analyze for the validating life or lives
for each of these vesting events. In our search for validating lives for these vesting events,
we find that yes, we do have a validating life for B's interest. A can serve as a validating life
because at the end of A's life, the class of A's children will close, thus vesting B's interest.
However, the contingent remainder in A's grandchildren is problematic. We do not have the requisite
validating lives. Why? Because we would need to have a closed class of A's children to serve as a
validating life for ascertainment of the identity of A's grandchildren. Because the class of A's
children is open at the time of this conveyance, we do not have the requisite validating lives,
and therefore the contingent remainder in A's grandchildren is void. And as you recall,
if an interest is void under Rule Against Perpetuities analysis, it is considered void
ab initio from the beginning as if the conveyance had been drafted without that interest.
Any interest that is void under Rule Against Perpetuities analysis must be stricken from the
conveyance. In our example then, the conveyance now reads to A for life, then to A's children for
their lives. The language remainder to A's grandchildren has been stricken.
So what then is the state of the title as a result of this conveyance? A has a life estate,
B has a vested remainder subject to open in life estate, and O has a reversion.
Let's reconsider this example, changing one fact. If instead of an intervibos conveyance,
what if the testator, T, devises to A for life, then to A's children for their lives,
remainder to A's grandchildren, and we're told that A pre-deceased T, would this change the result?
The answer, of course, is yes, because the class of A's children is already closed when the conveyance
became effective, which of course was on T's death. Therefore, the contingent future interest
in the grandchildren will vest or fail no later than the death of A's last child to die. So in
other words, the class of A's children, because it is a closed class under this example, can serve as
the validating life for the remainder in A's grandchildren. Let's consider one final example.
O conveys to A for life, then to A's children who reach age 21. We're told that at the time of the
conveyance, A is alive and has one child, B, age six. Following our three-step approach,
the first part of our analysis is to identify any contingent future interest in a transferee.
That analysis reveals that, yes, B has a contingent future interest. B has a contingent
remainder. B is a child of A, and there is a condition precedent. B must not only be a child
of A, but B must reach the age of 21. Keep in mind that this vesting event, being a child of A and
reaching age 21, applies not only to B, but to any other children that might be born of A. Generally,
when we identify an interest in a conveyance, once we have a known taker,
that identification is with reference to that taker. But if A has more children,
obviously those children will likewise have a contingent remainder. Now we need to analyze
whether we have a validating life for this vesting event. Yes, we have a validating life
for this vesting event. That life is A, because at A's death, all of A's children will be known,
and no later than 21 years thereafter, we will also know who among them has reached the age of 21.
Note, this conveyance demonstrates an example of when we do, in fact, need that 21-year period
in order to validate the contingent future interest. This interest in A's children who
reach age 21 is valid because we will know at the conclusion of A's life, the validating life,
who all of the potential takers are, and we will know no later than 21 years after A's death,
who among those children have reached the age of 21. So what is the state of the title? A has a life
estate, B has a contingent remainder, and O has a reversion. Why does the transferor have a reversion?
Because it is possible that B's contingent remainder will not vest if B fails to reach the age of 21,
and it's also possible that A may not have any children who satisfy that condition precedent.
And now the time has come for the most important step in your mastery of the rule against
perpetuities, and that is practice, practice, practice. Good luck.

There is a very interesting thing.
For the past two weeks, we've looked at consecutive possessory interests, present and future.
Now we turn to concurrent possessory interests, also known as co-tenancies.
We'll examine the characteristics of the different types of co-tenancies, how they are created, and how they may be terminated.
We'll also look at the rules that govern the relations among co-tenants, and what remedies exist if not all of the co-tenants play by those rules.
Let's take a closer look.
Concurrent ownership is one of three types of ownership.
The labels that we give to these types of ownership stem from the nature of the possessory rights of the owner or owners in question.
Inseveralty, ownership refers to the right of one owner who has sole and exclusive possession.
Consecutive ownership refers to an estate that is divided among rights of both present and future interest holders.
These are the rights that we have studied for the past two weeks.
Now we turn to concurrent ownership, in which there are concurrent rights of present or future possession.
And here is the key feature of concurrent ownership.
Each tenant in a co-tenancy has a possessory right to the undivided whole.
More on that in a moment.
Under the category of concurrent ownership, there are three types of co-tenancies.
Tenancy by the entirety, joint tenancy, and tenancy in common.
We will now look at the features that distinguish these three types of co-tenancy.
When more than one person has a concurrent interest in property, how do we know what type of co-tenancy exists?
Two steps are important in answering this question.
One, we must look at the unities of title that existed when the co-tenancy was created,
and we must look at the specific language that was used.
We're going to next turn to a deeper understanding of what these two factors involve.
The unities of title refer to characteristics that have to exist at the time the co-tenancy is created.
I use the acronym TIP, T-T-I-P-P, to help you remember these five unities.
The first is the unity of time, meaning that the interest must be acquired or must vest at the same time among the co-tenants.
The unity of title refers to title that is granted by the same instrument or that arises through joint adverse possession.
The unity of interest means that each co-tenant must have an equal and undivided interest of the same duration in the property.
Unity of possession is the one unity of title that must exist for each of the three types of co-tenancies,
and this means that each co-tenant has the equal right to possession of the undivided whole.
The last unity of title refers to unity of person, and that simply means marriage.
We'll now look at what unities must exist for each of the three types of co-tenancies.
A tenancy by the entirety, which can exist only between married persons, is the co-tenancy that requires all five unities of title.
Now, while only married persons can qualify to hold property as tenants by the entirety, it is not necessary that they do so.
They may choose to hold property as joint tenants or tenants in common.
A joint tenancy, which can exist between any two persons, requires only the first four unities of title, time, title, interest, and possession.
The third type of co-tenancy, a tenancy in common, requires only the unity of possession.
What that means is that tenants in common may acquire their interests at different times through different title instruments,
and their proportionate share of the property may also be unequal.
Of the three types of co-tenancies, only tenants by the entirety and joint tenants enjoy a right of survivorship.
Looking at the two examples, in the tenancy by the entirety, we label the interest that the spouses have as each having an undivided one-half interest in the estate.
In the joint tenancy, in our illustration, there are three joint tenants.
They have equal and undivided interests, so we would label this as each having an undivided one-third interest in the estate.
Let's see how the right of survivorship operates to affect those interests.
Let's look first at the tenancy by the entirety.
When one spouse dies, the other spouse survives to the whole, unencumbered by the deceased spouse's share.
In other words, the surviving spouse does not receive anything from the deceased spouse.
The deceased spouse's interest is extinguished at that spouse's death.
With a joint tenancy, where we had three joint tenants, each with undivided one-third interest,
when B dies, A and C survive to the whole, unencumbered by B's interest.
Once again, A and C do not receive their increased share from B.
B's interest is merely extinguished at his death, and now A and C each have an undivided one-half interest in the whole.
Because a tenancy by the entirety exists only between married persons,
when one spouse dies, the surviving spouse then holds title in severalty.
With a joint tenancy, however, if there are more than two joint tenants to begin with,
then when one joint tenant dies, the remaining joint tenants still hold the estate in a joint tenancy.
In our example, A and C each have an undivided half interest as joint tenants.
Now let's look at a tenancy in common for purposes of comparison.
In our example, A, B, and C hold undivided one-third interest as tenants in common.
If B dies, what is the result?
Well, B's estate will hold an undivided one-third interest as a tenant in common with A and C.
What if there is an intervivos transfer of the interest of one of the tenants in common?
If C sells her interest to D, D will hold an undivided one-third interest as a tenant in common with B's estate and with A.
The creation of a co-tenancy depends not only on satisfaction of the required unities of title,
but also on the inclusion of the appropriate language.
With a tenancy by the entirety, some jurisdictions have a statutory presumption
that the creation of a concurrent estate in spouses creates a tenancy by the entirety.
In such jurisdictions, this is the default position unless contrary language is included in the grant.
It is good drafting policy nonetheless that when a tenancy by the entirety is intended,
that the appropriate terminology should be used in the grant.
Please note that spouses can choose to hold property instead as joint tenants or tenants in common,
so when drafting for married persons, it's essential that you be crystal clear what the client's intentions are
and that the conveyance be drafted with the appropriate language.
Creation of a joint tenancy must include wording that indicates an unequivocal intent to create a true joint tenancy.
Examples of such language include in joint tenancy with right of survivorship,
or as joint tenants with rights of survivorship.
Without this unequivocal language, the modern-day presumption is that a co-tenancy is a tenancy in common.
Because all co-tenants have a right to possession of the undivided whole,
we label their interests as fractional interests in the undivided whole.
A key question is, does a co-tenant have the right to unilaterally convey his or her fractional undivided interest?
The answer to that question, if it's a tenancy by the entirety, is no.
Neither spouse has the right to unilaterally sever or convey their fractional interest.
With a joint tenancy, the answer is yes.
A joint tenant can unilaterally convey the interest, but the consequence of this is significant.
What this conveyance does is destroy the survivorship right of that severing tenant.
So the tenant who unilaterally conveys gains with certainty the value of that fractional share,
but loses the possibility of surviving to the whole.
With a tenancy in common, yes, all tenants in common may unilaterally convey their fractional interests.
You now have an overview of how each co-tenancy may be created.
It's time to look at how each may be terminated.
If you recall, a tenancy by the entirety may not be unilaterally severed by either spouse.
To terminate a tenancy by the entirety, it must be by a mutual written agreement or by divorce
or by execution on a judgment by a joint creditor of both spouses.
One of the advantages of a tenancy by the entirety is that the entirety interest is not vulnerable
to the liabilities of only one of the spouses.
In order for a creditor to execute against a tenancy by the entirety,
it must be a joint creditor of both spouses.
To terminate a joint tenancy, that can happen by unilateral severance where there are only two joint tenants.
However, if there are more than two joint tenants, the remaining joint tenants will continue to hold their interest
with rights of survivorship after unilateral severance by one.
The other means of terminating a joint tenancy is partition, and that can be a voluntary partition
that is accomplished by the joint tenants through seeking a resurvey of the property
and dividing up the property in kind, meaning each joint tenant ends up with a parcel of equal value,
or it may be impractical to partition in kind,
and the joint tenants may instead choose to sell the parcel and divide the proceeds.
When there is disagreement among the joint tenants, then an action in partition may be sought through judicial resources,
and depending on the circumstances, the court may order a partition in kind or a partition in sale.
The Delfino case that we'll examine this week looks at those issues.
And last, the tenancy in common likewise can be terminated through a partition, either voluntary or judicial.
Now let's apply what you have learned.
These examples compare a joint tenancy with a tenancy in common.
In the joint tenancy, we're told that A, B, and C hold Blackacre as joint tenants,
and that C has conveyed his interest to D.
We are to determine the state of the title.
Recall that when C conveys his interest to D, that severs the joint tenancy as to C.
So the result is that A and B continue as joint tenants to an undivided two-thirds interest in Blackacre,
but they are now tenants in common with D as to his undivided one-third interest that results from the conveyance that C made.
Let's look at the tenancy in common and compare.
A, B, and C hold Blackacre as tenants in common.
C conveys his interest to D.
What is the state of the title?
In this scenario, A, B, and D each have an undivided one-third interest as tenants in common.
C's undivided one-third interest as a tenant in common was merely transferred to D, who holds an interest of the same nature.
One need only observe a preschool class to be reminded that problems with sharing are inherent in human nature.
Co-tenancy disputes are cases in point.
Next, we'll look at the question of sharing not only from the standpoint of the goodies or the benefits connected to co-owned property, but also the burdens.
Without doubt, the most challenging aspect of co-ownership, both in theory and in practice, is that each co-owner has an equal right to possession of the whole.
How can that possibly work if co-tenants have different and conflicting notions about property use?
Due to the inherent difficulties of the right to equal possession of the whole, the law favors agreements for sorting out the sharing of benefits and burdens among co-tenants.
Where there is a valid agreement or contract between or among co-tenants, the court will respect that, and that will supersede what the rights of the co-tenants would otherwise be under the common law.
Next, we'll look at what the common law provides with respect to a co-tenant's right to share benefits and duty to share burdens.
With respect to sharing the benefits of co-owned property, there are basically two categories.
One has to do with rent or value received from third parties, in other words, from persons or entities who are not co-owners,
and the other has to do with profits generated by a co-tenant's own labor or business activities or the value of possession from a co-tenant who is in sole possession.
Let's look first at rent or value coming from third parties.
The answer is yes, absent agreement, co-tenants have a right to share in rent or value from third parties,
and they share in proportion to whatever their fractional interest in the property happen to be.
With respect to profits generated by a co-tenant's own labor or business activities or the value of that co-tenant's sole possession,
the answer is no, co-tenants do not have a right to a share unless there is an agreement that provides otherwise,
or the other co-tenants have been ousted by the co-tenant in possession.
In other words, they've been prevented from enjoying their rights to equal enjoyment of possession of the property.
Also, there are exceptions when a co-tenant has depleted natural resources from the property.
What about sharing the burdens associated with co-owned property?
Must a co-tenant share the burden of taxes and governmental obligations?
What about mortgage payments?
The answer is yes, absent an agreement to the contrary.
Must a co-tenant share the cost of repairs and improvements on a co-owned property?
The answer to these questions is more complicated.
Under the traditional common law approach, a co-tenant was not required to share the cost of a repair.
Instead, the co-tenant who paid for the repair was entitled to a credit,
and the credit would be paid at such time as there was an accounting for other benefits
or the property was sold and the proceeds distributed.
Under the more modern view, if a repair is of the type that would be viewed as objectively necessary,
and the co-tenant who intends to make the repair gives the other co-tenants advanced notice of the necessity of the repair,
then the co-tenant who has paid the cost may seek contribution from the other co-tenants.
With respect to improvements, a co-tenant who voluntarily makes an improvement of co-owned property
is not entitled to seek contribution for that improvement.
The rationale is that an improvement is a subjective expenditure.
The consequence of expending funds to make an improvement is this.
The co-tenant who makes the improvement is entitled to any appreciated value,
either in the overall value of the property or in the rent that can be charged.
However, if the improvement turns out to decrease the value of the property,
that tenant is also responsible for the diminution in value.
So let's take an example.
Let's say that a co-tenant decides to put on a room addition of a residence that's being rented out for the rental income.
Because of the addition, the residence can now be rented for an additional $100 a month.
If the improving co-tenant can show that this increase in rental value is due to the improvement,
the improving co-tenant will be allowed the additional $100 a month
on top of what his or her share would be of the rents normally collected.
If, on the other hand, a change is made to a property,
let's say that one of the bedrooms is now converted into a hot tub room,
and the co-owners are now getting less rent for the property because it has fewer bedrooms,
then that diminution in the rental value will be deducted from the portion of the co-tenant
who converted the bedroom into a hot tub room.
What are the remedies available to co-owners with respect to sharing the benefits and burdens of co-owned property?
If a co-tenant wishes to collect his or her share of a benefit, such as rents from third parties,
the action that is brought is one for accounting.
If, instead, a co-tenant wishes to collect the share of cost of taxes or a mortgage payment from other co-tenants,
the action is one for contribution.
If there is damage to property interest due to the actions or failure to act of other co-tenants,
the action that is brought is one for waste.
And if a co-tenant wishes to separate the interests or terminate the co-tenancy,
typically the action that is brought is one for partition.
Now it's time to test your knowledge and to attempt the multiple-choice questions that are posted.
