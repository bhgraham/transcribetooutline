Several simple Westlaw features will save you hours of research time by streamlining how you
take research notes, how you organize your research, automatically adding citations to
your writing, and more. First, you should know about three simple features you can use right
within your document's text. First, notes and highlights. Take notes or highlight cases,
statutes, or other documents right within Westlaw, and your annotations will be saved every time
you return to that document. You can even share your notes and highlights with others. That way,
when they open the same document, they will see all of your great work. Second, copying with
reference. In other words, copying a citation. Instead of trying to write out the full citation
on your own, just copy text from any document, and Westlaw will create a citation and automatically
add it when you paste your text. Even the pin site, the particular page your text was copied from,
will be inserted in the site. Another simple must-use feature when diving into your research
is folders. Create folders for each research project, or each issue within a project, and
save any cases, statutes, or anything else in one place so you can find it later. And what's brilliant
is not only can you save the entire document in folders, but also snippets of text that you want
to use later. But Westlaw's folders do even more than just store documents or text snippets. For one
thing, Westlaw will constantly update the key site information, so if a case or statute is later
rendered invalid, you can see it at a glance right inside your folder. For another thing, Westlaw offers a
special folder analysis feature that analyzes the documents from your folder and suggests missing
authority or helpful research topics. Just upload all the relevant documents for an issue you're working on,
do the rest. One of the neatest tools in folders is a research report. With a click of a button,
Westlaw will prepare a quick report of all the research you put in the folder. This is great
if you want to quickly capture a snapshot of your research for yourself or others on your team.
The report will list every source in your folder as well as summaries of each. Finally, you can add
notes to folders, upload your own documents, search across all your folders, and even share folders
with others. You're bound to find some great research one day and then forget about it later.
Westlaw's research history makes jumping back in your research a breeze. You can review all your
recent searches or all the recent documents you've viewed. You can search within your history to
quickly find that document you're looking for. And you can even peruse a visual history that will show you each step in your
research process, just in case you ever need to go back. Finally, as you research, you'll start to see
that Westlaw is always helping guide you to helpful authority. One feature constantly doing this is
research recommendations. As you work within Westlaw, an algorithm automatically notices patterns in
your searches and documents that it uses to make recommendations to you. Westlaw's research
recommendations will suggest legal issues, cases, statutes, and secondary sources related to your
research. It even focuses on the jurisdictions you select. Let's jump on Westlaw and see how a law clerk
uses some of these simple features. Marco is working on a memo about a disability discrimination claim
under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Marco found some very helpful quotes in a case,
Osborne v. Baxter, and wants to make sure he can find them later. He considers just casing them into an open
Microsoft Word document, but Westlaw offers better tools than that. First, Marco can copy any snippets
of text with the citation already included. All he needs to do is highlight the text, then pick the
citation format. Here he wants Blue Book, so he sticks with the standard format. Next, Marco can highlight
and add notes right in the document so that he can be sure to remember why the snippet was helpful. He can
even color code his notes or highlights to keep track of different issues. Another law clerk on his team,
Andrea, is also interested in some of these same legal issues. No problem. Marco can download this case
with his notes and highlights included, or directly share a link to the case, and Andrea will be able
to see Marco's annotations too. Now Marco is ready to save his case for later and continue researching.
Westlaw folders makes that easy. He just clicks the folder icon and selects which folder to save
the case in. Marco is ready to keep researching. Luckily, Westlaw has been learning from his
research and the cases he puts in his folders. Marco can see research recommendations anytime by
clicking up here in the research recommendations. Westlaw is constantly working to help you find more
and more relevant cases in other sources. Marco can also click on folder analysis and ask Westlaw to
review the cases in this folder and suggest other helpful research to add. Marco can see topics populating the
legal issues panel. For each of these issues, there are recommendations of cases, statutes, and court rules, as well as secondary
sources related to his topic. Finally, Marco's done for the day, but he wants to share what he found with Andrea
so that she can use it for her research. He simply selects the research report button, and voila, an organized report
of everything he found. Marco annotated his cases, used AI search features, and organized his research, all without
leaving Westlaw. Now hop on to Westlaw and try these cutting-edge features and tools for yourself.
