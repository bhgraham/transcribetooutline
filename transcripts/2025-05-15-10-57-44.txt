We are now entering the study of estates and land. Estates are the basic building blocks of
both real estate practice and estate planning. Our system of estates and land is built on the
English common law system that developed in feudal times, and as such, you're going to find
the terms and the nomenclature very unfamiliar. But just like names arbitrarily given to individuals,
the only way to really master this terminology is to memorize it and to practice making the
associations between those terms and the interests they represent. In this video, I offer you a
methodical approach to learning estates and land and to distinguishing between the present and the
future interests that the parties have in those estates. Let's take a look. There were four
categories of estates in feudal England, the fee simple, the fee tail, life estate, and leasehold
estates. And despite the intervening centuries between feudal England and our modern day,
we have not added any new estates to this system of possessory interests. And in fact,
we no longer recognize the fee tail estate in the United States, so we will not study that. That was
an estate that was created to keep land within the bloodline of a family in feudal times. So we
will concentrate on the fee simple, on the life estate, and leasehold tenancies we will put aside
to week six, where we will give them concentrated study at that time. Estates are present possessory
interests that are measured in terms of duration. The fee simple has two categories, fee simple absolute
and fee simple defeasible, which we'll explore in greater depth in a moment. The life estate is one of
the few estates that is pretty much what it sounds to be, and that is an estate measured by a person's life.
This graphic sets out the basic distinction between a fee simple absolute and a fee simple
defeasible, and that distinction is one of duration. The fee simple absolute is a potentially infinite
duration, while the fee simple defeasible has a limitation or a condition subsequent built into
the conveyance that creates it that may cause it to terminate upon the violation of that limitation
or the occurrence of that condition. There are three types of fee simple defeasible, which we will
look at in a moment. The fee simple determinable, the fee simple subject to condition subsequent,
and the fee simple subject to executory limitation. Before we examine the feasible fees, let's look
first at the fee simple absolute. The language of conveyance to create a fee simple absolute may
appear as to A and his heirs or simply to A. The language to A and his heirs was necessary in
feudal times because and his heirs was used to denote heritability of A's fee. What do we mean by
heritability? It means that A's interest could descend to A's legal heirs at his death. Prior to this point
in time, if someone were given a possessory interest in land, which usually happened in exchange for
services to the king or to the lords that served under the king, this interest was not one that
could be alienated or that could be passed on to heirs. Well, when the fee simple absolute was first
recognized, it was not alienable and it actually was not divisible, meaning it could not be designated
to someone in a will, but it was heritable. And to indicate that this type of interest was being
created, the words and his heirs was added to the conveyance. But please note that those words and his
heirs creates no direct interest in the heirs. These words are considered merely words of
limitation, meaning that they denote what is being conveyed, a fee simple, rather than being words
of purchase, which indicate who takes. So in this conveyance to A and his heirs, to A are words of
purchase indicating who takes, and his heirs are words of limitation that simply denote that a fee
simple absolute has been created. Today, it is no longer necessary to include the terminology and his
heirs or and her heirs in a conveyance when the objective is to create a fee simple absolute. And where
those words may appear, it is important that you remember that these are just words of limitation and not
words of purchase. Also in our system of estates, it is important to note that a fee simple interest is
alienable, divisible, and descendable. If you will recall, when I set forth the context for what we
were going to study this semester, I talked about the typical ways that property interests are created
and the two categories, creation inter vivos and creation at depth. So when we say an interest is
alienable, we're talking about an inter vivos transfer of some type. To say that it's divisible means that it
passes through a will, and to say that it's descendable means that it is passed through intestate
succession, which is controlled by statute, when a person has neither planned with a will or with
non-testamentary devices such as beneficiary designations. Next, we turn to the fee simple,
defeasible. There are three types of defeasible fees. The language that's used to construct the
conveyance is determinative of the type of defeasible fee. There are component parts to these
conveyances that will help you identify correctly every time out what type of defeasible fee has been
created and what the consequences will be for those who hold the present or future interest in the
conveyance. Unlike so many areas of the law, this area has a right and a wrong answer. So for those who
resonate to that type of analysis, you'll love this area of the law because once you learn the
component parts, you will be able to correctly analyze a problem set without fail each time out.
Okay, let's start out with looking at the basic construction for each type of defeasible fee.
The first one on this graphic is the fee simple determinable. You will recognize this because in
each fee simple determinable, there is incorporated into the conveyance durational language. In my example,
it's to a so long as, but the durational language might be something like to a until, to a during such
time as. All of those phrases are durational and create the limitation that is wrapped right up
in the creation of the defeasible fee. The other two types of defeasible fees contain a condition
subsequent. So the construction would be 2A, but if, now insert the condition subsequent, if this
condition happens, then there is a consequence. In a fee simple subject to condition subsequent,
the consequence is that the transferor, O, has the right to reenter. With a fee simple subject to
executory limitation, if the condition subsequent happens, the consequence is that another transferee,
in my example B, that transferee's interest will divest the holder of the defeasible fee.
So let's recap again. The fee simple determinable must contain durational language that sets out a
limitation on the fee holder's interest. In the other two types of defeasible fees, there is a
condition subsequent, and the distinction between the two turns on who holds the future interest. If it's
the transferor, we're looking at a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. If it's another
transferee, it's a fee simple subject to executory limitation. Now we're going to look more closely
at each of these types. Let's look first at the fee simple determinable. In our example, O conveys
green acre to A, so long as the land is used for farming. A is said to have a fee simple determinable,
and this is the present possessory interest in this conveyance. Note that the durational limitation is
built right into the fee that is created. What is the limitation? That the land is used for farming.
That durational language, so long as the land is used for farming. Now we could have phrased it to A,
until such time as the land is no longer used for farming. Or we could have said to A during the time
that the land is used for farming. So it could be different types of durational language, but what's
essential is that it is creating a durational limit on that fee that if the limitation is violated,
the fee is what we call defeased. The fee ends. So given that this is the present possessory
interest, this fee simple determinable, if the land is no longer used for farming, who then has the
present possessory interest. The answer to this question is that O, the transfer or, would once
again have a fee simple absolute. Now let's look more closely at the transfer or side of this
transaction. When O conveys green acre to A so long as the land is used for farming, O has some type of
an interest that if A's interest is later defeased because the limitation is violated, O has an interest
that can then become possessory and restore O to a status of having a fee simple absolute. What do we
call the interest that O has when the fee simple determinable is created by O? That interest is
called a possibility of reverter. A possibility of reverter is among a class of interest known as
future interest. Why do we label this a future interest? First, it should be noted that a possibility
of reverter is a presently existing legal interest. But what is future in its character is that the
possibility of possession is in the future. So let's look at our conveyance again and suppose that A
continues to use the land for farming throughout A's lifetime. So in other words, the limitation is
never violated. O's possibility of reverter then never became possessory. So that's why it's a
possibility of reverter. The possibility exists that the limitation, the land being used for farming,
might be violated, in which case O would then once again have the present possessory interest.
Note that if the limitation in a fee simple determinable is violated, the possibility of reverter
becomes possessory automatically. So let's recap what we've learned about the fee simple determinable.
In the conveyance, O conveys green acre to A, so long as the land is used for farming. If you are asked
to identify the state of the title to green acre, what is the appropriate response? A has a fee simple
determinable, and this is the present interest because that is the present possessory interest in the
estate. O has a possibility of reverter, which is known as the future interest. If you recall, the other
two types of defeasible fees each contain a condition subsequent. First, let's look at the fee simple
subject to condition subsequent. Our example is that O conveys green acre to A, but if A no longer
uses the land for farming, O has the right to reenter. The phrase, but if A no longer uses the
land for farming, is known as a condition subsequent. If you look at the construction, think of it in
these terms. The conveyance grants something to A, but the phrase, the condition subsequent, but if A no
longer uses the land for farming, is the mechanism that could take it away. That is the condition
subsequent. A is said to have a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, and A's interest, this
defeasible fee, is the present possessory interest. What is unique to a fee simple subject to condition
subsequent is that the transfer or, O in our example, holds the future interest. O has the right
to reenter. A distinction between a fee simple subject to condition subsequent and a fee simple
determinable, which we just looked at, is that with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent,
O's right to reenter does not result in automatic divestment of A's defeasible fee, but it gives O
the option to reenter. In other words, O must exercise the right to reenter. What happens if
A no longer uses the land for farming, and O does not exercise the right to reenter? Well, if the
period of time for asserting property interest passes, in other words, the statute of limitations
passes, A would then have a fee simple absolute unencumbered by the condition subsequent. So once the
condition subsequent happens, it starts the statute running that sets the time period within which
O has to assert O's right to reenter. So what is the label that we give to O's interest at the time
that O creates the fee simple subject to condition subsequent in A? We call O's interest a right of
entry. It is sometimes also phrased as a power of termination. The right of entry is called a
future interest because there is the possibility of a future right of possession. Although the possessory
interest is future, a right of entry or power of termination, if phrased that way, is a presently
existing legal interest, just not a possessory one. Let's then review the fee simple subject to
condition subsequent. In our example, O conveys green acre to A, but if A no longer uses the land
for farming, O has the right to reenter. What is the state of the title? The correct answer is that A
has a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, which is the present interest, and O has a right of
entry, the future interest. The third type of defeasible fee is the fee simple subject to
executory limitation. Like the fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the fee simple subject to
executory limitation always contains a condition subsequent. In fact, in our example, O conveys
green acre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming, then to C, the condition subsequent is
exactly the same condition subsequent as we used in our fee simple subject to condition subsequent
illustration. That being, but if A no longer uses the land for farming. What is different between the fee
simple subject to executory limitation and the fee simple subject to condition subsequent is that in
the fee simple subject to executory limitation, the future interest is held by another transferee
rather than the transfer or. In this example, then to C creates an executory interest in C,
and if the condition subsequent occurs, A no longer using the land for farming, the executory interest in
C will automatically divest A's fee. If you recall, in our example of the fee simple subject to
condition subsequent, the right of entry in O was not automatic upon the occurrence of the condition
subsequent. O had to exercise that right. In contrast, the executory interest in C, in this
example, does operate in an automatic fashion to divest A's fee. A, in this example, is said to have
a fee simple subject to executory limitation, and this is the present possessory interest until or
unless the condition subsequent happens. You should also note that in some literature, this defeasible
fee is known as a fee simple subject to executory interest. The terminology executory limitation
and executory interest are interchangeable. With a fee simple subject to executory limitation,
if the condition subsequent happens, who then has the present possessory interest?
The answer, of course, is C, who held the executory interest, now has the present possessory interest,
which we call a fee simple absolute. So let's review the fee simple subject to executory limitation.
If the conveyance is O conveys greenacre to A, but if A no longer uses the land for farming,
then to C, what is the state of the title to greenacre? The answer is that A has a fee simple
subject to executory limitation, which is the present possessory interest, and C has an executory
interest, which is a future interest. This recap comparison of a fee simple subject to condition
subsequent with a fee simple subject to executory limitation should help you keep these two types
of defeasible fees distinguished. While they both contain a condition subsequent, the most obvious
difference is that with a fee simple subject to condition subsequent, the future interest is in
the transferor, and the language indicates that interest has either a right to reenter or a power
to terminate. With a fee simple subject to executory limitation, the future interest is in a
transferee, and that interest is an executory interest. A distinction in terms of the way that
defeasement operates in each of these defeasible fees is that with the fee simple subject to condition
subsequent, the fee is not automatically divested when the condition subsequent occurs. The transferor
has to elect to use the right to reenter or the power to terminate. With a fee simple subject to
executory limitation, the fee is automatically divested by the executory interest. Now let's look
at the easiest estate to recognize, the life estate. A life estate is either measured by the transferee's
life or measured by the life of another. Our example O conveys to A for life illustrates a life estate
measured by the transferee's life. O conveys to A for the life of B is an example of a life estate
measured by the life of another in this example B. A life estate that is measured by the life of
another is known as a life estate per autre B. Whether the life estate is measured by the transferee's
life or by the life of another, the life estate is the present possessory interest. When a life estate
is created, as in the examples illustrated, who has the future interest? The answer is that O,
the transferor, has the future interest known as a reversion. Note at the conclusion of the life
estate, O's future interest becomes possessory. When that happens, we classify O's interest as once
again a fee simple absolute. Let's recap. If O conveys Greenacre to A for life, what is the state of the
title to Greenacre? A has a life estate, the present possessory interest. O has a reversion, the future
interest. Now let's apply what you've learned about estates and land. Please answer the questions in
this week's self-paced material on estates and land.
Now that you are familiar with present possessory estates and land, it's time to learn future
interest. A future interest is a presently existing legal interest that will or may become possessory
in the future. At first encounter, most students find future interests daunting. My goal in this
video is to introduce you to a methodology that will help you identify and analyze future interests
correctly each and every time out. Think of it like a board game. You have to know the rules before you
can play. That's what this video is about, so let's have some fun with future interests.
Perhaps without realizing it, you have already learned the class of future interests that can be held by a
transferor. There are three types, the reversion, the possibility of reverter, and a right of entry or
power of termination. A transferor retains a reversion any time the transferor carves out a
lesser estate than what the transferor has. So in the instance of a transferor who has a fee simple
absolute, when a life estate is carved out, the transferor retains a reversion in fee simple absolute.
So in our example, O conveys to A for life. At the end of A's life, which is the end of the life estate,
O's reversion becomes possessory once again, and O is restored to a fee simple absolute.
The possibility of reverter accompanies the creation of a fee simple determinable. Our example,
O conveys to A so long as A uses a land for farming. Now if you recall, a defeasible fee is of
potentially infinite duration. So long as A uses a land for farming, A's fee simple determinable will
not be defeased. But if A ceases to use the land for farming, then O's future interest, the possibility
of reverter, automatically becomes possessory. The right of entry, power of termination, as you recall,
does not operate in an automatic fashion. This future interest in a transferor accompanies the
creation of a fee simple subject to condition subsequent. In this example, O conveys to A,
but if A no longer uses the land for farming, that's the condition subsequent, O has the right
to reenter. If A no longer uses the land for farming, O has to exercise that right to reenter.
Now let's turn to future interests in the transferee. There are three types of future interests,
the contingent remainder, the vested remainder, and the executory interest. A contingent remainder
occurs when the transferee is either not ascertainable, or the vesting is subject to a condition
precedent, or possibly both. With a vested remainder, you know who the transferee is,
and there is no condition precedent. The executory interest is defined as a divesting interest on a
condition precedent. Now I realize that this all just sounds like definitions, and that you need
something more concrete to be able to recognize these interests when they appear in a conveyance.
I'm now going to give you a step-by-step approach to help you do that. Let's look first at remainders.
If you recall, the general classification of remainders includes both contingent remainders and vested
remainders. In either category, to be a remainder, there must be something for the remainder to remain
after. That something is a prior supporting estate in a transferee. That will be the present possessory
interest. A prior supporting estate must be a lesser estate than a fee simple absolute or a fee simple
defeasible. Why? Because a fee simple absolute or fee simple defeasible is of potentially infinite
duration. In order to be a prior supporting estate, it must be possible for a remainder to become
possessory at the natural expiration of that estate. Let's look at some examples that illustrate the
concept of a prior supporting estate. In our first conveyance, O conveys to A for life, then to C if
C graduates law school. We look for the present possessory interest, and that is a life estate in
A. What remains after is a contingent remainder in C, which contains the condition precedent if C
graduates law school. It is possible in this conveyance that at the natural expiration of A's
life estate, in other words at A's death, that C's remainder interest could become possessory if in fact
C has graduated law school. In the next conveyance, to A for the life of B, then to C, what C has is a
vested remainder. We know who C is, and there is no condition precedent. The prior supporting estate
to A for the life of B is a life estate per autre B, a life estate measured by the life of B. At the
natural conclusion of that life estate per autre B, C's vested remainder will become possessory.
In the third example, to A for five years, then to B's children, what A has is a term of years. We
haven't studied this yet. It is one of the leasehold estates. Then to B's children is a remainder,
and what type of remainder it is depends on facts that are not apparent on the face of this
conveyance. If B is dead and all of B's children are known, then it's a vested remainder. If B is
alive and has no children yet, it's a contingent remainder because we have an ascertainment issue.
Now for the sake of comparison and contrast, let's consider examples where there is no prior
supporting estate for the transferee's future interest. In the first example, O conveys to C
if C graduates law school. Note O has retained the present possessory interest, and if C graduates
law school, C's future interest divests O's present possessory interest. In the next example, O conveys
to A, but if A dies before B, then to B. In this example, it's a transferee that has the present
possessory interest, but note if A dies before B, A's interest is actually divested, and B's interest
becomes vested in possession. So rather than there being a present possessory estate in a transferee
that concludes at the natural expiration of the estate, in this instance, A has a fee simple subject to
executory limitation that could be of infinite duration. But if the condition subsequent happens,
A dying before B, then B's interest, which we call an executory interest, shifts and divests A. So in
these examples, we do not have remainders, we have executory interests. And as we'll see later in this
video, the interest to C in our first example is also an executory interest, but it behaves differently
than the one in B in our second example. What is the difference? The executory interest in C will
divest the transfer ore, whereas the executory interest in B divests another transferee.
When analyzing a conveyance that contains a future interest in a transferee, I recommend that you
first analyze it to determine whether the interest is a remainder. Let's look at this example. To A for
life, then to B, if B reaches the age of 25. The first question you should ask is, where is the
present possessory interest, and does it qualify as a prior supporting estate? The answer to the first
question in this example is yes. The present possessory interest is a life estate in A, and it qualifies as
a prior supporting estate. Once we know that we have a prior supporting estate, we also know that
what follows is a remainder interest in the transferee. Now we have to determine what kind
of remainder interest. I recommend that you next look at whether there is an ascertainment issue
and whether there is a condition precedent. In this particular example, there is not an
ascertainment issue because we know the taker. The taker is B. However, when we look at the language of the
conveyance, we see that there is a condition precedent. What is a condition precedent? A condition that must
happen before the taker's interest vests in possession. The condition precedent in this conveyance
is B reaching the age of 25. Because there is a condition precedent and there was a prior supporting
estate, B has a remainder known as a contingent remainder. Let's look at another example. In this
conveyance, O conveys to A for life, then to B. Of course, our first question is, do we have a prior
supporting estate? The answer is yes. We have a life estate in A that is the present possessory interest,
and it qualifies as a prior supporting estate. Next, we analyze to determine whether this is a
contingent remainder. Remember that the two questions we ask are whether there's an ascertainment issue
and whether there is a condition precedent. In this conveyance, the answer to both questions is no.
B is a known taker, and there is no condition precedent to B's interest vesting. Thus, what B has is a
remainder known as a vested remainder. Now that you have the general guidelines for distinguishing a
contingent remainder from a vested remainder, it's time to take a closer look at both of these
categories to understand the different types of contingent remainders and vested remainders that
can occur. In the category of contingent remainders, any one of three circumstances will yield a
contingent remainder, either an ascertainment issue, a condition precedent, or both. The example to A for
life, remainder to A's children, the remainder to A's children is contingent because at the time of the
conveyance we're told that A has no children, and thus we have an ascertainment issue. In the second
example, to A for life, remainder to B if B survives A, the remainderman B is ascertained. However, there
is a condition precedent. In order for B's remainder to vest, there is a condition precedent that B
survives A. In the last example, to A for life, remainder to A's children who survive A, we have
both circumstances, both an ascertainment issue and a condition precedent. We're told that at the
time of the conveyance, A has no children, which is the ascertainment issue, and there is also a
condition precedent that those children, if A has any, must survive A for that remainder to vest.
Now let's return to the examples where there is no prior supporting estate for the transferee's
future interest. These are known as executory interests. In the example, O conveys to C if
C graduates law school, the present possessory interest is retained in O, and the interest
in C is known not only as an executory interest, but as a springing executory interest. In the
second example, O conveys to A, but if A dies before B, then to B, the present possessory interest
in A is known as a fee simple, subject to executory limitation, and B's interest is known as a
shifting executory interest. The definition of an executory interest is that it is a divesting
interest on a condition precedent. Now I just mentioned that there are two types of executory
interest, springing and shifting. It's fairly easy to see from our two examples how an executory
interest is a divesting interest. So it becomes possessory not at the natural expiration of a prior
supporting estate. It becomes possessory by divesting another present possessory interest,
either a present possessory interest in the transferor or a present possessory interest
in a transferee. It's a springing executory interest when it springs back and divests a
transferor, and it's a shifting executory interest when it shifts over and divests another transferee.
Now the definition, a divesting interest on a condition precedent, many students find confusing.
Let's look at the more straightforward example of this. O conveys to C if C graduates law school.
If we look at the wording to C if C graduates law school, the wording if C graduates law school
looks like a condition precedent. So it's easy to understand in that example how the springing
executory interest is a divesting interest on a condition precedent. What becomes confusing is
the circumstance of the shifting executory interest, and why is that so? If we look at the
conveyance O conveys to A, but if A dies before B, then to B, what we recognize in that conveyance is
the condition subsequent. We learned when we studied the feasible fees that this is a fee simple subject
to executory limitation because of that condition subsequent, but if A dies before B. So if this
conveyance contains a condition subsequent, how can we say that the shifting executory interest
is a divesting interest on a condition precedent? Here's the answer. When we label interest,
we always go from left to right. But if A dies before B is called a condition subsequent because
it refers to the preceding interest, that the feasible fee in A. It's the condition that happens
after that can divest A's fee simple subject to executory limitation. But consider that same
condition, but if A dies before B, while it operates as a condition subsequent that can take away,
divest A's interest, that same condition operates as a condition precedent to B's shifting executory
interest vesting. However, the label is condition subsequent because it refers to the preceding
interest. So while we never call that a condition precedent in the operation of B's shifting
executory interest, what B has is a divesting interest on a condition precedent, the condition
subsequent that takes the interest away from A and vests it in B. Congratulations, you've now learned
all of the basic rules to recognize and work with future interests. I recommend that you watch this
video several times and then practice, practice, practice. You'll have plenty of opportunity for that
with handout problems in the live lecture, as well as the problem sets in the self-paced units. Good luck!
In the first video lecture for this week, I introduced you to the concept of future interests. As you recall,
a future interest is a presently existing legal interest, but what is future about that interest
is the possibility of possession. In the prior video, we explored, in general, the entire landscape
of future interests, including interests that can be held by a transferor and those that can be held
by a transferee. Future interests in a transferee include executory interests as well as remainders,
and remainders are further classified as either contingent or vested. Now, within those classifications
of remainders, there are further details that are important to your ability to recognize and correctly
label remainder interests, and that's what we will focus on primarily in this video presentation.
As you may recall, in order to have a remainder, there must be something for that remainder to
remain after, and that something is a present possessory interest in a transferee that qualifies
as a prior supporting estate. You may recall from the introductory video that a prior supporting
estate is one that is of a lesser duration than a fee simple absolute or a fee simple defeasible.
So, in other words, it is generally a life estate, a life estate per entre vie, or a leasehold estate
known as a term of years. Now, it need not be certain that the remainder will become possessory upon the
natural expiration of that prior supporting estate. It need only be possible. And what do we mean by the
natural expiration of that prior supporting estate? Well, if it is a life estate, it is simply the end
of the measuring life for that life estate. Or if it is a term of years, it is the conclusion of that
time period set out for the term of years leasehold estate. In other words, there doesn't have to be
the happening of a vesting condition. It is just the natural expiration of that prior supporting estate.
To put into perspective the remainder interest, it's helpful to contrast it with executory
interest. If you recall, an executory interest vests in possession only by divesting another
interest. In other words, there is a condition that serves as that vesting event. And again,
the remainder simply vests in possession upon the natural conclusion or expiration of that prior
supporting estate. Let's review the graphic that summarizes executory interests. If you recall,
executory interests are known as divesting interests on a condition precedent. This is because the only
way that an executory interest can become possessory is by the happening of a condition
that will divest the current holder of the possessory interest and vest into the holder
of the executory interest possession. Executory interests are labeled with reference to whether
the interest will divest a transferor or will divest another transferee. The executory interest
that divests a transferor is known as a springing executory interest. I find it helpful to think about it
as springing back to the transferor and divesting that transferor if the vesting event occurs.
With the shifting executory interest, the holder of the present possessory interest
is another transferee. So if we think about the two sides of the conveyance, one being the transferor
and the other one being the transferee side, an executory interest is on the same side as the
holder of the possessory interest. If we look at our example of a shifting executory interest,
it helps to illustrate this point. O conveys to A, but if C graduates law school, then to C.
A, a transferee currently holds a fee simple subject to executory limitation. C has the shifting
executory interest, and the vesting event, but if C graduates law school, is the condition
subsequent as to A's interest that actually acts like a condition precedent to the vesting
of C's interest. If C graduates law school, C's executory interest shifts over and divests
A. In contrast, our first example, O conveys to C, if C graduates law school, the present possessory
interest in this example is held by O, the transferor. It is a fee simple subject to executory limitation,
but one held by a transferor. So the condition to vesting if C graduates law school is more apparent
in its nature of a condition precedent because it is the thing that has to happen if C's executory
interest is going to spring back and divest the transferor. Now let's consider these examples
of conveyances that contain remainder interest. Hopefully our brief review of executory interest
will help you distinguish a remainder interest from an executory interest. Now in each of these
conveyances, I have highlighted in yellow the portion that constitutes a remainder. We will come back
to each of these separately to determine exactly what type of remainder is created. Before we do
that, though, I would like to look at the prior supporting estate in each of these conveyances.
If you recall, in order to have a remainder in a conveyance, there must be something for that
remainder to remain after, and that something is the prior supporting estate. A prior supporting
estate is an estate of a lesser duration than either a fee simple absolute or a fee simple defeasible,
and it must be at least possible for the remainder to vest in possession at the natural expiration
or conclusion of that prior supporting estate. So in our first example to A for life, we have a life estate,
and while it is not certain that C will have graduated law school by the end of A's life,
it is at least possible. In the second example to A for the life of B, this is a life estate per
Atra B. So at the end of B's life, then C's interest is to vest in possession. What if C happens to die
before B? It doesn't matter because C's remainder interest can pass to C's estate. In the last example
to A for five years, we have what's called a term of years or a leasehold estate. It's to A for five
years, then to B's children. What if in five years B doesn't have any children yet? Again, it doesn't matter.
What's important is that it's at least possible, and so we have a remainder interest that is
remaining after this prior supporting estate. So let's take a look more closely at each of these
conveyances to determine the proper label for the remainder interest contained in each.
In our first example, O conveys to A for life, then to C if C graduates law school. What C has is a
contingent remainder. Why is it contingent? Because there is contained within that remainder a condition
precedent. That condition is if C graduates law school. In our second example, O conveys to A for the
life of B, then to C, C has an indefeasibly vested remainder. We know who the taker is, and there is
no condition precedent to the vesting, nor is there a condition subsequent that could take it away. So it
is an indefeasibly vested remainder. In our third example, O conveys to A for five years, then to B's
children. We need more information before we can put a label on this remainder interest. So what do we
need to know? Well, the relevant questions are, is B alive, and does B have any children?
If B is alive, but B has no children, then the remainder is a contingent remainder. Why? Because the
takers, the potential takers, are unascertained. If B is alive and has at least one child, then the
remainder is labeled as a vested remainder subject to open. And what subject to open means is that that
child's interest could be partially divested by the birth of more children. The remainder remains subject
to open until the class of B's children is closed. When does that happen? Closure of that class will
happen on B's death. And what if B is dead at the time of this conveyance? If B is dead and has
children, then the remainder is an indefeasibly vested remainder. The takers are known and the
class is closed. So B's children will share proportionately in this vested remainder. As you
will recall, there are two basic categories of remainders, contingent and vested. Let's review the
features of each. Contingent remainders occur when we have an ascertainment issue in the conveyance.
If you take a look at the example on the graphic, to A for life, remainder to A's children, and we're
told that A has no children at the time of the conveyance. So the potential takers are unascertained.
Or there is a condition precedent. Our example with a condition precedent is to A for life, remainder to
B, if B survives A. Or the conveyance has both, both an ascertainment issue and a condition precedent.
So our example for this is to A for life, remainder to A's children who survive A, and we're told that A has no
children at the time of the conveyance. So while a remainder may be considered contingent for different
reasons, no matter what the reason, ascertainment, condition precedent, or both, we simply call that
remainder a contingent remainder. If we know at least one taker and there is no condition precedent
to vesting, the remainder is some type of vested remainder. That said, there are three types of vested
remainders. The most easily recognizable vested remainder is the indefeasibly vested remainder.
In our example, the conveyance is to A for life, remainder to B. We have a known taker, there is no
condition precedent, and there is no condition subsequent. The second type of vested remainder
is vested subject to open. Our example, to A for life, remainder to B's children. And in this example,
we're told that B is alive and has one child, D. This is a class gift. So with a vested remainder
subject to open, we know at least one taker, but we have an open class of takers. The third type of
vested remainder, vested subject to complete divestment, occurs when the remainderman has the interest,
the future interest, but could lose it upon the happening of a condition subsequent. So in our example,
to A for life, remainder to C, but if C fails to survive A, then to B, C has a vested interest.
However, C could lose it upon the happening of the condition subsequent. And that condition in the
conveyance is, but if C fails to survive A. Who would take if that condition happens? Well, B would take.
B has the shifting executory interest. Now, while there are only three types of vested remainders,
indefeasibly vested, vested subject to open, and vested subject to complete divestment, and this is
sometimes phrased simply as subject to divestment, while there are only those three types, it is
possible for a taker to have a vested remainder that is both subject to open and subject to complete
divestment. Consider the example. O conveys to A for life, then to B's children, but if B has no
children that survive A, then to C. In this example, we're told that B is alive and has one child, D.
So D has a vested remainder subject to open. His interest is a part of a class gift to B's children,
and so if additional children are born to that class before it closes, D's interest will be diluted.
But D's interest is also subject to complete divestment. What would the divesting event be
that could completely take away D's interest? It would be that on the death of A, that none of
B's children survive A. In the event of that occurrence, then D's interest would be completely
divested. So again, for now, just keep in mind that while there are three types of vested remainders,
it is possible for a remainder to be both subject to open and subject to complete divestment. This
occurs when you have both a gift to an open class or conveyance to an open class, and you have a
condition subsequent that could completely divest that interest. So let's recap. With a contingent
remainder, either no taker is ascertained, there is a condition precedent, or both. Regardless, all
contingent remainders are simply called contingent. With a vested remainder, we know at least one
taker, and there is no condition precedent. The three types of vested remainders are indefeasibly
vested, vested subject to open, and vested subject to divestment. Those learning future interests, and
particularly remainders, often have difficulty distinguishing between conditions precedent and
conditions subsequent. The key question to this determination is, must the condition happen before
or after to vest possession? If the condition must happen before, then it is a condition precedent.
And if it happens after, in other words, it operates to take possession away from one transferee
and vest it in another, then it is a condition subsequent. Let's look at condition precedent examples.
O conveys to A for life, then to C, if C graduates law school. If C graduates law school is a condition
precedent to C's interest, a contingent remainder vesting. In the second example, O conveys to A for
life, then to C, if C graduates law school, and if C does not graduate law school, to D. This example
looks similar to the first because we have the condition precedent if C graduates law school
necessary to vest possession in C, but then we have the reverse of that, and if C does not graduate law
school, operating as a condition to vest possession in D. What these remainders in this example are called
is alternate contingent remainders. They are alternate because if the condition happens,
C graduating law school, possession goes to C. And if the condition does not happen, C does not
graduate law school, it goes to D. So these are alternate contingent remaindermen, and the vesting
of possession depends on the happening or the failure to happen of the same condition. In our last example,
O conveys to C if C graduates law school. This is a condition precedent, but what we have in this
example is not a contingent remainder. Why is this not a contingent remainder? Because if you recall,
a remainder must remain after something on the transferee side of the conveyance. In this example,
the present possessory interest is held by O. O holds a fee simple subject to executory limitation,
and that means, of course, that what C has is a springing executory interest. So to review, in our
first conveyance to A for life, then to C if C graduates law school, C has a contingent remainder.
In the second conveyance, O conveys to A for life, then to C if C graduates law school, and if C does
not graduate law school, to D, C and D have alternate contingent remainders. And in the last example,
O conveys to C if C graduates law school, C does not have a remainder, C has a springing executory
interest, because if the condition precedent happens, C graduating law school, C's interest will divest O,
the transferor, of O's fee simple subject to executory limitation. Now let's look at condition
subsequent examples. Our first example, O conveys to A, but if C graduates law school, then to C.
But if C graduates law school is the condition subsequent in that conveyance. In the second
example, O conveys to A for life, then to C, but if C fails to graduate law school, then to D. We have
the same condition subsequent, but if C fails to graduate law school, but what the interests are
labeled in these conveyances are very different. Let's take a closer look. In our first example,
the present possessory interest is held by A, and that interest is called a fee simple subject to
executory limitation. C has a shifting executory interest. Upon the occurrence of the condition
subsequent, C graduating law school, A's interest is divested, and C's shifting executory interest
shifts over into possession. In our last example, the present possessory interest is the life estate in
A. It is followed by a remainder interest in C. This is a vested remainder because we know who the
taker is, and there is no condition preceded. However, it is followed by a condition subsequent.
That condition is but if C fails to graduate law school. If that condition subsequent happens,
it will operate to divest C of C's vested interest. So what C has is a vested remainder subject to
divestment, sometimes referred to as subject to complete divestment, and the divesting interest,
the shifting executory interest, is held by D. Following this video, I have designed two problem
sets to test your knowledge of future interests in the transferee. I have divided the problem sets
into executory interest treated in one and remainder interest in the other to help reinforce what you
have learned about the distinguishing characteristics that separate executory interests from contingent
remainders and from vested remainders. Good luck with these.
