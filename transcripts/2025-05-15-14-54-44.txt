Court decisions, also called cases, are often the key authority you need to tackle your
research projects.
Luckily, Westlaw makes it a breeze to find the perfect cases that will get you the answers
you need.
Let's start with some basic case concepts, and then we'll explore some case research
in action.
Before diving in, you'll need some basic information about what sort of cases you're
looking for.
Start by noting the jurisdictions most relevant to your research project.
Usually, this will be the state or federal jurisdiction that your research project is
based in.
You'll also want to note the main legal and factual points raised by your issue.
Westlaw offers many tools to help you find just that right case.
But the simplest way to get started is a plain language search.
That's as easy as typing in keywords, just as if you were searching for something on
the internet.
Westlaw uses sophisticated AI combined with attorney expertise to find helpful cases based
on your search language, even if a case doesn't use the same exact words that you typed in.
the case easily used filters to limit your search results based on when a case was decided,
whether it's reported, the legal issues it discusses, the causes of action involved, and
much more.
After you've found a case that you think might be useful, Westlaw offers several tools that
will make it easy to figure out what the case is about and whether it will help you with
your research project, without making you read the whole case.
Most cases on Westlaw begin with a synopsis, which is a summary of the case, including the
most relevant facts, holdings, and outcomes, allowing you to instantly check if a case
relates to the issues you're researching.
After the synopsis, you'll find summaries of the legal issues and holdings in the case, called
headnotes.
Headnotes are created by attorney editors at Westlaw.
Basically, our attorneys have already read the case, pulled out the most useful legal
issues, and summarized them for you.
If the synopsis or headnotes discuss issues you think are important to your research project,
you'll know the case is worth reading more carefully.
If not, you can quickly move on to the next case and save hours in research time.
But headnotes do more than just offer a snapshot of legal issues and holdings.
Westlaw categorizes every headnote within the key number system.
This system connects headnotes across cases, allowing you to instantly jump into other cases
that have discussed the same legal issue.
The key number system does even more though.
Westlaw and our attorney editors take all of those headnotes and organize them into topics.
That way you can explore relevant issues within a topic, even if you aren't sure how to create
your own search to find them.
With the click of the button, you can see all the cases out there having the same conversation.
It's like using a hashtag within a legal research platform.
A final basic tool you should know about when it comes to cases is the key site flag system.
An important part of analyzing a case is to know whether other courts or statutes have
overruled, distinguished, or followed the case.
If you see a yellow flag next to a case name, this means there is some negative treatment
of the case, but it hasn't yet been overruled.
A red flag warns that the case has been overruled and there are other flag types that will provide
even more information about how the case has been treated.
Let's now see how these concepts come together in a real research project.
Andrea is doing research on a disability discrimination claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA.
The client has sued their employer, a software company, because it didn't provide
Andrea's client with reasonable accommodations. First, Andrea needs to jump in and find her cases.
She knows the ADA lawsuit is filed in California Federal Court, which is in the Ninth Circuit,
so she first selects the Ninth Circuit as a relevant jurisdiction.
Andrea knows that the issue she's researching is about reasonable accommodations under the ADA,
so that makes for an easy keyword search.
As she starts typing, Westlaw is already making suggestions for helpful resources.
She can go directly into these resources, or just click to run her search.
Andrea first sees Westlaw's recommended head notes right here at the top.
She can jump straight into one of those head notes, or she can store or filter the full results
to narrow in on cases that she's most interested in.
Some common ways to filter results, or the date the decision was issued,
the key number, which, remember, is just an organized list of all the head notes out there,
or the reporting status.
Westlaw offers you other exclusive ways to filter, too.
You can narrow in on cases that discuss a particular legal issue, a similar fact pattern to your
case, cases that deal with causes of action relevant to your issue, and more.
Sometimes you need to narrow your search results by looking for a particular fact or sub-issue.
Use the Search Within Results feature to easily narrow a search into a more specific topic.
Andrea eventually decides to jump into the first case that Westlaw suggested, Ravel vs Hewlett Packard.
She sees several head notes mentioning reasonable accommodations.
Great, she's on the right track.
This case has a yellow flag up top, which means that other cases or authorities may have treated it negatively,
like by distinguishing its holding.
Andrea clicks on the citing references tab, and sees that several cases have indeed distinguished the Ravel case,
so those will be important to read later, but Ravel is likely still good law.
Back in the case, Andrea finds a great quote that she thinks will be helpful to her research project.
She highlights the text.
She can save the text to an outline.
Add her research to a folder, making it easy to find later.
She can add color-coded notes or highlights.
Or, she can copy the text with a reference.
You can see there are a variety of citation options available.
Now Andrea can paste the text she copied in her own document, and the citation will already be written for her.
That's it!
Andrea jumped into Westlaw and used several features to find helpful cases, and it took only moments.
Now head to Westlaw, and see how easy it is to find that perfect case.
Ravel installs it?
Yeah, I can see.
It is a great quote.
Because theidoffistry's wasn't so unique to her.
It is not an exact question.
So I talk about them!
It is基本.
Go, in the comments!
